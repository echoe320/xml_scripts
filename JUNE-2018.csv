0,Earning More by Doing Less: Human Capital Specialization and the College Wage Premium,"(None, 'Titan', 'M', 'Alon')",Economics,In Copyright,"[""This paper builds a model of human capital accumulation driven by increasing specialization of the workforce. Individuals increase the efficiency of time dedicated to human capital acquisition by focusing investments on narrower sets of skills. The evolution of secondary and post-secondary curricula in the United States from 1870-2000 confirms the presence of these changes in the \\textit{scope of specialization}. Quantitative exercises show that specialization can account for roughly 29\\% of the rise in the skill premium, and 25-30\\% of the rise in relative educational attainment from 1965-2005. The effect on the skill premium is largely due to a decline in specialization in high school, where vocational training was replaced with academic graduation requirements. The model's predictions are also consistent with international variation in the skill premium, attainment levels, and the organization of educational institutions. An important policy implication of the analysis is that making room for specialized occupational training in secondary schools could be an effective tool to tackle income inequality.""]",01/01/2018,Economics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Alon_northwestern_0163D_14104.pdf
1,Efficient Charge Transport in Architecture-Controlled Perovskite-Based Core-Shell Nanowire Arrays,"(None, 'Michael', None, 'Ashley')","anodic aluminum oxide, coaxial lithography, core shell nanowires, electrodeposition, nanotechnology, perovskite nanowires",In Copyright,"['Nanostructured semiconductors exhibit promising optoelectronic properties, such as high photoluminescence quantum yield and efficient charge separation, making them attractive materials for applications including photovoltaics, LEDs, and lasers. These superior properties are often due to improved crystallinity and reduced charge separation distance compared to bulk semiconductors. As a result, it is desirable to synthesize uniform and highly crystalline nanostructures of arbitrary composition and placement relative to adjacent materials. Metal halide perovskites have emerged as a new class of solution-processable, high-performance semiconductors; however, complex compositions and poorly understood surface chemistry have precluded the synthesis of uniform perovskite nanostructures. Furthermore, controlled nanostructured interfaces (e.g. core-shell nanowires), which can dramatically reduce the distance excited charges must travel to be extracted for useful energy, have not been realized for perovskite-based systems.', 'Anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates allow one to overcome these synthetic challenges, as they enable the materials general synthesis of both oriented nanowires, as well as nanotubes that can encapsulate them, with uniform and tunable size. AAO templates are characterized by a dense array of oriented cylindrical nanopores with tunable diameter, length, and spacing; herein, their implementation for nanowire synthesis facilitated the study of diameter-dependent crystallinity in perovskites using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL). Compositional generality was also explored by synthesizing CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbBr3, and Cs2SnI6 nanowires, all using a simple spin coating method. Moreover, perovskite-based nanostructured interfaces were designed and synthesized within AAO pores, wherein desired materials were precisely placed in a core-shell architecture. This was accomplished using coaxial lithography (COAL), a powerful electrodeposition-based technique for the synthesis of nanorings and nanotubes with controllable dimensions and compositions. Combined with perovskite nanowire synthesis, COAL enabled the preparation of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite core – copper thiocyanate shell nanowires. One can use TRPL to monitor excited charge lifetimes and quantify the advantage of short charge separation distance for charge extraction; TRPL decay curves showed that the rate of charge extraction from perovskite by an adjacent semiconductor was accelerated by three orders of magnitude when a radial heterojunction (as opposed to an axial heterojunction only) was introduced.', 'Successful synthesis and characterization of core-shell nanowire arrays composed of complex materials validates AAO as a versatile template for nanomaterials by design. By combining multiple strategies for nanostructure synthesis within AAO (i.e. electrodeposition and solution-casting), this work sets the foundation for the development of a diverse library of composite nanomaterials with compositions, dimensions, and interfaces that can be tailored for a desired application.']",01/01/2018,Chemical and Biological Engineering,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Ashley_northwestern_0163D_14112.pdf
2,Traveling Waves in Models of Population Dynamics with Nonlocal Interactions,"(None, 'Eric', 'Arthur', 'Autry')","biological control, nonlocality, population dynamics, traveling waves",In Copyright,"['This thesis focuses on ecological models of population dynamics and the traveling, migratory waves that can result when a stable state either displaces an unstable state, or displaces another stable state. We consider the effect of nonlocal interactions, where members of the species interact over a distance. This gives rise to integro-partial differential equations of reaction-diffusion type. Our work has encompassed two projects. The first considers a single species competing nonlocally with itself, while the second considers a food chain system of three species. In both, we consider traveling waves and determine how nonlocality can affect the speed of propagation, the stability of the equilibria, and the shape of the fronts.', 'In our first project, we developed a piecewise linear, reaction-diffusion model describing the growth and movement of a single species, u, so that when we considered a particular form of nonlocality, we were able to reduce the integro-PDE to a system of algebraic equations. This allowed a full description of the traveling wave solutions. We also considered the effects of asymmetric nonlocality, where the distance over which the nonlocal interactions occurred was different to the left and to the right of a given location. We were able to show how the extent of the nonlocality and the strength of the asymmetry affected the speed of propagation of the traveling fronts, and how they could cause a loss of monotonicity in the solutions. Finally, we considered cases where the waves could propagate in either direction.', 'In our second project, we considered a three species food chain model, where species u was preyed upon by species v, which in turn was preyed upon by species w. Our primary focus was on biological control, where the bottom species u is an important crop, while v is a pest that has infested the crop. The superpredator w is introduced into this pest-infested environment in an attempt to restore the system to a pest-free state. For this model, we considered two types of nonlocality: one where the crop species u competes nonlocally with itself, and the other where the superpredator w is assumed to be highly mobile and therefore preys upon the pest v in a nonlocal fashion. In this context, we examined how biological control could prove to be highly susceptible to noise, and could fail outright if the pest species was highly diffusive. We showed, however, that control could be restored if the superpredator was sufficiently diffusive, and that the control could be made robust if the superpredator behaved nonlocally. Since our focus was on biological control, where the superpredator is generally introduced artificially, our results point to properties of the superpredator which can lead to successful control.']",01/01/2018,Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Autry_northwestern_0163D_14132.pdf
3,Neural Mechanisms of Olfactory Categorization and Navigation in the Human Brain,"(None, 'Xiaojun', None, 'Bao')",Neurosciences,In Copyright,"['The brains of humans and animals have the amazing capability of extracting abstract relationships between external stimuli efficiently. Knowing such regularities helps us compute and react to novel information flexibly without prior experience. The olfactory system is no exception. Animals need to infer commonalities across different odors sharing similar meaning, while preserving individual distinctions across these odors. They must also locate and predict sources of odors to optimize their proximity to the odor-emitting objects. The neural mechanisms underlying these critical olfactory cognitions are still full of questions. In two independent fMRI experiments, we investigated how the human brain represents 1) categorically organized odor objects, and 2) two-dimensional odor space constructed by two-odorant mixtures.', 'In the first experiment, we took advantage of the anatomical organization of the olfactory system and delivered the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen to suppress associative input to human piriform cortex. Multi-voxel pattern analyses revealed that baclofen disrupted pattern separation of within-category odors in the piriform cortex, and disrupted pattern separation of odor categories in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the hippocampus.', 'In the second experiment, we uncovered evidence of grid-like coding with a two-dimensional virtual landscape constructed only of odors. We found that humans can learn to navigate through an odor space, and that the internal maps of the space take the form of periodic, hexagonally symmetric patterns in the entorhinal cortex, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the anterior piriform cortex, consistent with a grid-like arrangement.', 'Results from these experiments should advance our understanding of coding mechanisms by which the olfactory brain represents odors with relational organizations in different applications. They complement and extend earlier literature on olfactory cognition, and advance olfaction as a model system for further studies of relational memory.']",01/01/2018,Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program (NUIN),Dissertation,None,no embargo,Bao_northwestern_0163D_14080.pdf
4,Non-equilibrium thermodynamics of Quench and Partition (Q&P) steels,"(None, 'Amit', None, 'Behera')","austenite stability, carbide, carbon partitioning, paraequilibrium, quench and partition, steels",In Copyright,"['In support of a scientific foundation for the predictive design of composition and processing of quench and partition (Q&P) martensite/austenite TRIP steels, theory of coupled diffusional/displacive transformation is experimentally calibrated to control austenite carbon content and its associated mechanical stability. Under paraequilibrium constraint, the calibration quantifies an effective BCC stored energy that incorporates both stored and dissipated energy associated with displacive interfacial motion during the partitioning treatment. Consistent with prior study of bainitic transformations, the effective stored energy is found to decrease linearly with partitioning temperature, attributed to the effect of dislocation recovery on the forest hardening contribution to interfacial friction. The calibrations are based on highly accurate experimental measurements using electron microscopy, high-energy x-ray diffraction and 3D atom probe tomography to quantify the amount and carbon content of retained austenite as a function of Q&P treatment. Varying the initial quench temperature to vary the initial retained austenite amount, it is demonstrated that the effective BCC stored energy changes with the direction of motion of the interface in association with a sign change of the dissipation contribution, favoring greater C partitioning for BCC->FCC motion. The minimum time for completion of partitioning at the partitioning temperature is consistent with DICTRA paraequilibrium diffusion simulations incorporating the effective stored energy. Measuring retained austenite mechanical stability by the characteristic Msσ temperature below which transformation controls yielding, martensite nucleation theory is calibrated using the forest hardening friction derived from the partitioning experiments to define the characteristic nucleation site potency in the retained austenite. Model predictions of austenite carbon content and stability were validated using a set of new designed alloys with individually optimized Q&P cycles. ', 'Comparison of the stress-strain curves of the Q&P martensite/austenite samples with fully martensitic material shows little influence of the austenite on yield strength, but a dramatic reduction of the ultimate tensile strength by transformation softening which greatly reduces initial strain hardening, retaining higher hardening to higher strains for greatly enhanced flow stability. An unusual correlation between Msσ and the temperature of maximum ductility is attributed to a bimodal austenite stability associated with two morphologies of blocky vs thin-film in the martensite microstructure. ', 'A principal limitation of the Q&P martensite/austenite steels relative to their bainite/austenite counterparts is the more rapid tempering of martensite leading to a major fraction of the alloy carbon being lost to carbides. A preliminary parametric analysis correlating rate of carbide precipitation to paraequilibrium cementite driving force and coarsening rate constant predicts Cr as the most effective alloying element to retard carbide precipitation, with some support from literature data. Predictive design of carbide-free Q&P martensite/austenite steels could double the amount of optimal stability austenite for greatly enhanced TRIP to achieve useful ductility of significantly higher strength levels.']",01/01/2018,Materials Science and Engineering,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2019",Private,Behera_northwestern_0163D_14072.pdf

However, she added, the use of a new word does not imply that we understand what this novelty consists in. This dissertation is an attempt to understand the novelty of totalitarian evil. The central argument, following Arendt, is that this understanding requires a reconsideration of the notions of action and judgment. A further argument is that a radical reconsideration of action and judgment in response to a new form of evil in modernity takes place in Immanuel Kant’s practical philosophy, which influenced the political thought of two prominent post-totalitarian thinkers: Arendt and Jean-François Lyotard. The first part of the dissertation analyzes the relationship between evil and action in Kant and Arendt. For both thinkers, evil consists in the destruction of responsibility for action, which stems from the capacity to begin, transform ourselves, and establish relationships with others. The second part analyzes the relationship between evil and judgment in Kant and Lyotard. In their view, evil corrupts the power of judgment by concealing its uncertainty under absolute rules that preclude disagreement. The conclusion argues that action and judgment imply the exposure and endurance of uncertainty, while evil stems from the attempt to eliminate uncertainty.']",01/01/2018,Political Science,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Burdman_northwestern_0163D_14063.pdf

This event is familiar to scholars of Religion, American Religious History, and U.S. Catholicism, for all of whom it marks an important historical pivot in culture and practice. The story of the Latin Mass, and its mid-20th century exile, has subsequently come to occupy a central symbolic place in the construction of popular as well as scholarly ideas about religion, modernity, and political responsibility. The language reforms of the middle to late 1960s were opportunities for U.S. Catholics and those who studied them to emphasize certain aspects of many interwoven liturgical strategies, but the narrative that emerged surrounding these events often ignores local projects in favor of projecting a story about the obvious suitability of English for post-war U.S. Catholic practice.', 'This dissertation explores liturgical reform projects undertaken by two urban Catholic dioceses between 1940 and 1974, a period including but not confined to the vernacular language reforms of the 1960s. I argue that liturgical reform both before and after the Second Vatican Council was a category name for efforts by liturgical activists with related but not identical agendas. They hoped to use the persons, spaces, and ambience organized within the Mass to create a common U.S. Catholic identity suitable to the range of religious and civic activities in which Catholics found, or hoped to find, themselves. This attitude would operate outside the Mass, but it would be especially legible in the bodies, faces, and voices of individuals who helped to create the experience of the Mass for each other each Sunday. ', 'In the 1940s, a limited interest in the phrase active participation inspired numerous conversations in Catholic liturgical publications. Attending to these conversations yields historically situated definition of active participation as a phrase with useful authority for inspiring liturgical campaigns and for disciplining the Catholics involved in them. In early 1950s Boston, one such campaign gave diocesan liturgical experts the opportunity to create a significant local community of liturgically expert lay Catholics simultaneously enjoined to capitalize on the growing political and cultural strength of white Catholics, especially men, after the Second World War. Both the narrative and strategies adopted by the archdiocese of Chicago for standardizing vernacular worship in the 1960s continue this pattern, simultaneously working on local Catholics as members of a religious community and as citizens in this period of relative political, economic, and cultural success for white middle class families. ', 'With the advent of the vernacular, largely English, Mass, scholars of and within Catholicism identify a tradition that has finally become a producer of American political virtues. Yet, both before and after the council, liturgical activists used Mass education programming to form Catholic parish communities. Before the Council they did so using English as an educational supplement to Latin celebration. After, they used English as both a measure of participation and a guarantee of communal modernity. To understand vernacular liturgy as a liberation of U.S. Catholics is to miss both the continuity of liturgical discipline across this period and the triumphal nationalism that is smuggled into U.S. Catholic history by uncritically accepting a uniformly English Mass as metonymy for lay freedom, maturation, and spiritual fulfillment.']",01/01/2017,Religious Studies,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Callaghan_northwestern_0163D_14001.pdf

This dissertation asks at the most general level: What is the relationship of race, ethnicity, and religion for early-generation Americans? More specifically, this dissertation answers this question through a comparison of second- and third-generation Irish Americans and Mexican Americans living in ethnic enclaves on Chicago’s Southside. This dissertation is built on evidence from a qualitative, multi-methodological comparative approach to delve deeply into the daily lives and experiences of Irish and Mexican Americans. ', 'Using evidence from a multi-year ethnography and eighty-two in-depth life narrative and visual elicitation interviews with early-generation Irish and Mexican Americans, this dissertation makes two broad claims: (1) Religious identities, beliefs, and practices cannot be understood apart from race, ethnicity, and the local environment, and (2) Religion remains relevant and persists on Chicago’s Southside partly because of, not in spite of, the importance of race and ethnicity in the local context. More specifically, I argue that the different racial contexts and experiences of Irish and Mexican Americans shape their everyday institutional and non-institutional religious practices. For the Irish Americans, the racial experience of being white amidst a predominantly Black far Southside bolsters a salient ethnoreligious identity (“Irish Catholic) which is centered around the local parish neighborhood and school. Moreover, because of the “perceived racial threat” of nearby Black neighborhoods, the Irish Americans feel they have no choice but to use the Catholic schools rather than the predominantly Black public schools, a phenomenon I call the “Catholic school imperative.” For the Mexican Americans, their racial experiences, namely with racism and structural inequality, bolsters a salient racial-ethnic identity and shapes the aims of their everyday Catholic practices toward addressing the effects of structural inequality in their daily lives. To this end, Mexican Americans use everyday Mexican Catholic practices such as home shrines and religious objects to protect them from the deleterious impact of systemic racism.']",01/01/2018,Sociology,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Carroll_northwestern_0163D_14125.pdf

The primary and most well-studied function of RNase P is its role in transfer RNA (tRNA) biogenesis, as it catalyzes the removal of an extraneous 5’ leader segment from precursor tRNAs. Previous studies have also shown that RNase P, which consists of a catalytic RNA subunit and at least one protein cofactor, can act on a variety of RNA substrates in addition to precursor tRNAs. The precise mechanism by which RNase P recognizes and distinguishes tRNAs and other non-tRNA substrates from the diverse pool of folded RNA molecules in a typical cell remains unclear, particularly when considering that some of its non-tRNA substrates are predicted to assume a completely different tertiary structure than tRNAs.', 'My approach to studying the substrate specificity of RNase P was to examine structurally how bacterial RNase P recognizes alternative non-tRNA substrates, as well as to investigate the structure and function of additional protein subunits that are unique to the archaeal and eukaryotic RNase P to better define the intricate relationships among substrate specificity, catalytic function, and structural organization of the RNase P macromolecular complex in the three domains of life.

In particular, the emerging field of electromagnetic and mechanical metamaterials offers fundamentally new capabilities in creating non-naturally occurring properties via rational designs at deep micro-/nanoscales. However, despite their potential to have a transformative impact on many applications, especially photonic devices, the lack of capable advanced micro and nanomanufacturing technologies imposes serious constraints which impede the successful translation of these exciting scientific discoveries into commercially viable products and applications. The wide gap between scientific research and the development of advanced manufacturing technologies poses many significant challenges in fulfilling the growing demand for photonic devices manufactured with increasingly fine details but without undermining their overall scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. For example, three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies still face the inherent speed-accuracy trade-off, which limits the overall scalability in manufacturing sophisticated 3D parts containing microscale and nanoscale features. Thus, this dissertation aims to bridge the gap between scientific discoveries and micro and nanomanufacturing methods to further facilitate the scalable manufacturing of multiscale photonic structures and devices. ', 'In this dissertation, hybrid top-down electro-beam lithography and bottom-up vapor–liquid–solid method are first integrated together to fabricate electromagnetic metamaterials comprising two-dimensional (2D) indium tin oxide nanorod arrays (ITO-NRAs), which support strong localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) at infrared frequencies. By exploiting the strong coupling of electromagnetic waves with induced electric dipoles at LSPRs in the ITO-NRAs, artificial tunable polariton bandgaps at infrared frequencies are investigated theoretically and experimentally. A theoretical model is first developed to understand the coupled phenomena underlying the unique characteristics of plasmon–polariton bandgaps. With high-degree control of the geometries of the ITO-NRAs, it has been experimentally demonstrated that controlling the near-field interactions among the neighboring electric dipoles allows for manipulation of the collective polariton modes. ', 'To further increase the manufacturing speed and scalability of metamaterials with sophisticated nanostructures, nanoimprinting and nanotransfer printing methods are integrated to accomplish the highly scalable nanomanufacturing of a metasurface comprising U-shaped nanowire resonators (UNWRs). This UNWR metasurface supports reconfigurable ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic hybridization of 2D artificial magnetic dipoles at optical frequencies, and its optical properties can be substantially manipulated by controlling the spatial and orientational arrangement of the magnetic dipoles. In addition, because of the existence of free-standing prongs, these nanoscale UNWRs support co-localized electromagnetic resonance at optical frequencies and mechanical resonance at GHz frequencies. The coherent coupling of these two distinct resonances manifests a strong optical force, which allows the UNWRs to dynamically change their optical properties upon the incident light. The all-optical modulation at the frequency at 1.8 GHz has thus been demonstrated experimentally using this UNWR metasurface. ', 'Furthermore, a time- and cost-effective single-photon projection micro-stereolithography (PµSL) method is studied to accomplish high-throughput 3D printing of customized photonic devices. The grayscale photopolymerization process and the meniscus equilibrium post-curing process are integrated to completely remove the pixelated surface roughness from the PµSL technique while maintaining a high fabrication speed at 24.54 mm3/h. We have demonstrated the capability to 3D-print optical elements, such as aspheric imaging lenses, with deep subwavelength surface smoothness (< 7 nm), sub-voxel-scale precision (< 5 µm), and high reproducibility, offering a highly reliable solution for the rapid prototyping of customized photonic devices with micro-/ nanoscale features from the optimized design.

10,Phenotypic and Functional Plasticity of Mast Cells in Homeostasis and Allergy,"(None, 'Krishan', 'Dilip', 'Chhiba')","Allergy, Biological sciences, Health and environmental sciences, IL-33, Innate Memory, Mast cells",In Copyright,"['Allergic diseases are increasing in prevalence worldwide. Existing allergy increases the risk for developing another allergy in the same individual. Approximately 80% of children with atopic dermatitis develop asthma or allergic rhinitis later in life in a process known as the “atopic march”. Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic inflammation is dependent on mast cell and basophil activation and release of mediators. Mast cells are long-lived tissue-resident hematopoietic cells that reside in nearly all tissues. Moreover, mast cells and their mediators have been shown to be particularly important for allergic responses and disease progression.  ', 'While mast cells and basophils are able to respond to several common stimuli, I hypothesized that each cell type would have unique activation-induced transcriptional signatures. Using mouse bone-marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) and basophils (BMBs), I compared IgE- and non-IgE-mediated activation phenotypes. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a cytokine linked to the development of several allergic diseases, and IL-33 has recently been shown to potently activate mast cells and basophils. By stimulating mast cells with IgE/antigen and IL-33, I demonstrated that mast cells have activation-specific transcriptional signatures. Furthermore, by performing the same analysis in basophils, I was able to characterize heterogeneity in basophil and mast cell responses to the same activating signals. The limited homology that we observe between these cell types after activation with the same stimuli suggests that these cells play unique roles in the immune response. From these analyses, I found that mast cells induce enhanced Il33 gene expression upon IgE-mediated activation, but not with IL-33 stimulation itself. We hypothesized that IL-33 does not act in an autocrine fashion. The activation-induced signature in IL-33-deficient and ST2 (IL-33 receptor)-deficient was not different from wild-type mast cells suggesting that IL-33 does not act in an autocrine manner. Lastly, since mast cells become activated in tissues where there is a limited oxygen supply, we asked if hypoxia effects the IgE/antigen-induced transcriptome. We demonstrated that the mast cell activation-induced transcriptome is not altered if the activation occurs in hypoxic culture conditions. ', 'From these transcriptional analyses, I found that IL-33-activated basophils selectively upregulate neutrophil-attracting chemokines, and I hypothesized that basophils help orchestrate allergic inflammation through this pathway. Using a model of mast cell-driven tissue inflammation, I demonstrated that mast cell-derived IL-33 acts on ST2-expressing basophils to promote neutrophil infiltration into murine ear tissue. Both mast cell-derived IL-33 and ST2-expressing basophils were both necessary and sufficient for antigen-driven tissue inflammation in vivo. These data define a mechanism for how mast cells via the release of IL-33 help to orchestrate a basophil-driven late phase inflammatory response during IgE-mediated inflammation. ', 'In addition to investigating these mast cell activation phenotypes, I explored the role of mast cells in the setting of chronic allergic inflammation. By developing an in vitro protocol for the repeated activation of mast cells, I demonstrated that stimulation of mast cells results in transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming akin to what can occur with other innate immune cells. These repeatedly activated mast cells become high expressers of IL-33 and take on an “trained” phenotype. Using a mouse model of the atopic march, I demonstrated that mast cell-derived IL-33 contributes to the progression of the atopic march by enhancing the severity of subsequently induced allergic airway inflammation. ', 'Lastly, I explored the regulation of the mast cell activation phenotype by Siglec-8 (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin-8) an ITIM-containing inhibitory receptor. Siglec-8 is expressed on human, but not on mouse mast cells. Working in collaboration with the Zhu lab at Yale University, I characterized SIGLEC8Mc, a new knock-in strain designed for the investigation of Siglec-8 in mice. Crossing a Mcpt5(connective tissue mast cell protease)-Cre mouse with a mouse that transgenically expresses human SIGLEC8-fl/fl resulted in a mouse selectively expressing Siglec-8 in connective tissue mast cells. In this mouse, I showed that mast cell number is unaffected by the transgene. Furthermore, I demonstrated that Siglec-8 is highly and specifically expressed on mast cells and not on eosinophils or other cells. Thus, this SIGLEC8Mc is a novel and unique tool to understand how Siglec-8 regulates the mast cell activation phenotype which will be explored in future studies.', 'In conclusion, this thesis document compiles a body of evidence that shows the remarkable diversity and plasticity of the mouse and human mast cell in homeostasis and allergy.']",01/01/2018,Driskill Graduate Training Program in Life Sciences,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,Chhiba_northwestern_0163D_14091.pdf

Motivated by the perceived dangers, policymakers often develop regulations to limit dollarization. In this paper, I draw attention to an important benefit of dollarization, which should be taken into account when crafting regulations. I argue that dollarization represents an insurance arrangement in which the entrepreneurs that own firms provide income insurance to households. Emerging market exchange rates tend to depreciate in a recession so that dollar deposits in effect provide households with income insurance. With their preference for holding deposits denominated in dollars, households effectively starve local financial markets of local currency, which raises local interest rates. By raising local currency interest rates, they cause entrepreneurs to borrow in dollars. Consistent with my argument, countries in which the exchange depreciates in a recession have a higher level of deposit and credit dollarization. In those countries, I verify that the premium of the local interest rate over the dollar interest rate is higher. This premium is the price paid by households for insurance.']",01/01/2018,Economics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Dalgic_northwestern_0163D_14129.pdf
14,The Roles of Primary Motor Cortex and Dorsal Premotor Cortex in Planning and Executing Movements under Uncertainty,"(None, 'Brian', 'M', 'Dekleva')","Bayesian behavior, Decision-making, Motor control, Motor cortex, Uncertainty",In Copyright,"['Each movement we make represents the final output of complex processes in the nervous system. Studies of motor control often attempt to minimize further complication by using controlled environments to generate repeated movements. However, in natural situations, the motor system faces the much more complicated task of interacting with an uncertain environment. Often this uncertainty arises from noise. For example, when attempting to swat a fly, we must rely on an erratic visual cue (the fly’s flight path) to estimate its future location and then develop the appropriate motor command. In this case, the goal of the sensorimotor system is to translate noisy sensory information into the single most appropriate action. At other times, uncertainty arises from the presence multiple discrete options. For example, when picking out an apple at the store, we examine the color and size of each one first and then reach to the one we deem best. In this situation, the uncertainty does not pertain to the executed movement itself—after all, the locations of the apples are static—but rather to the expected consequences for each option. The goal of the sensorimotor system in this case is to use sensory cues (and/or previous experiences) to decide between the multiple possible actions. Regardless of the source and type of uncertainty encountered during motor control, the sensorimotor system should also use the result (missing the fly or picking a rotten apple) to inform future situations. In this work, I examine how primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) plan and execute reaching movements when faced with noisy sensory information or multiple potential reach targets. I show that when faced with noisy information about a target location, PMd develops a low-fidelity reach plan, reflecting a subjective sense of uncertainty about the decision. I then show that when faced with two potential reach targets, neither PMd nor M1 contains multiple plans for both targets. Instead, motor cortex appears to decide on one option very quickly and later switches if required. Finally, I show that both PMd and M1 contain differential responses to the consequences (success or failure) of executed movements, potentially revealing a mechanism for driving motor learning within the network. These results together provide insight into how motor cortices cope with uncertainty when planning and executing movements.']",01/01/2017,Biomedical Engineering,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Dekleva_northwestern_0163D_14029.pdf

17,Synthesis and Characterization of Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Structures for Photovoltaic Devices,"(None, 'Daniel', 'Joseph', 'Fairfield')","Hybrid materials, Perovskite, Photovoltaic",In Copyright,"['Developing low-cost, scalable, high-efficiency photovoltaic materials is an important technological challenge because of the projected increase in global energy consumption in coming years, the environmental cost of carbon emissions, and the widespread availability of solar energy. This dissertation contains three studies on the development of novel hybrid materials as photovoltaic active layers and uses structure-processing-property relationships to improve efficiency and stability in these photovoltaic devices. In the first study, an electrodeposited hybrid zinc oxide-organic lamellar structure was investigated as a potential photovoltaic active layer. The zinc oxide-organic lamellar structure formed nanoscale p-n junctions, and novel synthetic organic dyes balanced visible light absorption with solubility in the electrodeposition solvent mixture. Morphological characterization revealed that the electrodeposited structures formed thick, porous films. Grazing-incidence X-ray scattering studies showed that the hybrid lamellar structure will electrodeposit with a variety of organic dyes with non-crystalline packing, but the inorganic domains were invariably sub-nanometer thick sheets based on the layered double hydroxide structure. Initial thin film device experiments yielded very low power conversion efficiency, and thus dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated with this nanoscale architecture as the active layer to improve efficiency in these devices. Single-step electrodeposition of these active layers represents a significant improvement to the throughput of the dye-sensitized solar cell manufacturing process. Functioning dye-sensitized devices were prepared from these lamellar scaffolds, although at lower efficiency than control bulk heterojunction or dye-sensitized devices. Various control devices and impedance spectroscopy explained why conventional device architectures such as dye-sensitized mesoporous scaffolds and bulk heterojunctions outperform this new nanostructured photovoltaic active layer. Specifically, within a dye-sensitized device, the electrolyte did not access the interior lamellar surfaces, and the dye molecules aggregated on the inorganic surface which caused recombination at the dye-electrolyte interface. In the second study, the stability of methylammonium lead iodide-based perovskite solar cells is improved by adding poly(acrylic acid) to the active layer. Adding polymers to methylammonium lead iodide perovskite solar cell active layers has previously been shown to increase the stability of the perovskite devices in dark, ambient conditions, but the nanostructures and stabilization mechanisms of these hybrid materials were poorly understood in these other studies. In this work, a structural and spectroscopic investigation on a number of perovskite-polymer hybrid materials was carried out, and their temporal stability as well as solar cell performance under operating conditions were compared. Using nanomechanical atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, perovskite crystallite sizes were observed to decrease with the addition of polymers, and the perovskite-polymer hybrid formed sub-micrometer-scale domains upon film casting. It is suggested that acid-base interactions, as well as facet-dependent interfacial interactions between perovskite and polymer, contributed to differences in stabilities of these hybrid materials. The polymers studied tended to suppress the formation of the hydrate crystal phase that accelerates the degradation reaction. Among these polymers, adding poly(acrylic acid) was found to significantly increase the stability of perovskite films under humid air and ambient illumination. Under these conditions, poly(acrylic acid)-perovskite hybrid solar cells maintained stable performance over a much longer time period than control devices. These results highlight the importance of choosing suitable functional groups in the polymer phase of perovskite solar cells to prolong their device lifetime. In the last study, novel layered perovskite structures were prepared using a systematic organic synthetic approach inspired by the approach followed in the zinc oxide studies. Layered perovskites have excellent environmental stability but poor photovoltaic function due to the preferential orientation of the semiconducting layers parallel to the substrate and the typically insulating nature of the cation. A series of these n = 1 layered perovskites with the form (aromatic-O-linker-NH3)2PbI4 were synthesized and characterized. These materials achieved enhanced conductivity perpendicular to the inorganic layers over three orders of magnitude higher than control layered perovskites with aliphatic organic cations due to better energy level matching between the inorganic layers and organic galleries. This study revealed two key structure-property relationships between cation conformation and optoelectronic properties. First, hydrogen bonding within the organic galleries can be used to avoid distortions of the inorganic lattice, resulting in narrower bandgaps. Secondly, out-of-plane conductivity in layered perovskites is enhanced by favorable π-stacking interactions within the organic galleries. The enhanced conductivity and absorption of these materials led to a champion power conversion efficiency of 1.24%, which is the highest value reported for a chemically stable n = 1 layered perovskite. As a whole, these studies demonstrate three different approaches to creating hybrid organic-inorganic photovoltaic active layers and demonstrate the importance of leveraging the optoelectronic properties of organic constituents in order to enhance the chemical stability and photovoltaic efficiency of devices.']",01/01/2018,Materials Science and Engineering,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,Fairfield_northwestern_0163D_14093.pdf
18,Activation and Perception of Native-Language Phonotactics in Bilinguals,"(None, 'Max', 'Ryan', 'Freeman')","bilingualism, parallel language activation, phonotactic constraints, speech perception",In Copyright,"['As monolinguals and bilinguals hear words unfold over time, they experience competition from words that share sounds within the same language (e.g., st- activates strict and stamp). Unique to bilinguals is that they are also prone to competition from similar sounding-words between their two languages (e.g., st- activates Spanish estrés (“stress”)). In the present dissertation, we examine how experience with multiple languages transforms the way in which speech sounds are activated and perceived. Specifically, we investigated how and if bilinguals activated and perceived native-language (L1) structures when processing words in their second language (L2) across three experiments. We used phonotactic constraints, which are rules for combining speech sounds, to examine activation and perceptual processes. A Spanish phonotactic constraint is that s+consonant clusters are not permitted at word onsets, and a vowel must precede the cluster (prothesis; e.g., English: strict, Spanish: estricto). In Experiment 1, we investigated whether bilinguals activated L1 phonotactic constraints when processing L2 words. We found that L1 Spanish-L2 English bilinguals accessed the L1 Spanish constraint. Bilinguals were faster to make lexical decisions on English-like words containing the activated ‘e’ onset rule (e.g., estomb) when primed with Spanish-conflicting words (e.g., strict), relative to non-conflicting stimuli (e.g., kneeling, prime: workers). In Experiment 2, the extent to which bilinguals perceived, or perceptually repaired, L2 words and L2-like non-words to sound more like L1 words was investigated. Response time results across vowel detection and AX discrimination tasks revealed mixed effects for L1 perception during L2 processing. Bilinguals perceived the ‘e’ onset in English s+consonant words (e.g., strict) when the beginning sound of the word was the focus of the task (vowel detection), but not when making low-level perceptual judgments on whether conflicting (e.g., strict and egg) versus non-conflicting (e.g., work and egg) word pairs were the same (AX discrimination). Experiment 2’s results suggest that when the beginning sound of the word is the explicit focus of the task, perceptual repair to the ‘e’ onset occurs. In Experiment 3, eye-tracking methodology was employed across a word recognition task and a combined word recognition and AX discrimination task. The goal was to examine the relation between activation and perception of L1 sounds during L2 processing. On the visual display, when a Spanish-conflicting English target word was present (e.g., strict), along with the potentially activated ‘e’ onset competitor word (e.g., egg) and two unrelated filler items (e.g., work, can), Spanish-English bilinguals with lower L2 (English) proficiency looked more at the ‘e’ onset competitor than the filler items. This pattern was observed on the two measures of word recognition. Moreover, in the combined word recognition and AX discrimination task, bilinguals did not perceive L1 phonotactics during L2 processing. Together, in Experiment 3, lower English proficiency bilinguals activated, but did not perceive, Spanish phonotactic constraints during English processing. Overall, the findings in this dissertation provide insight into the structure of acoustic space within the bilingual mind. L1 representations for sounds and words influence how L2 input is perceived. Speech perception and language activation are susceptible to interference from the L1. These results highlight the importance of accurately identifying differences versus disorders in bilingual populations. An L1 Spanish speaker learning an L2 (English) might not be able to identify and differentiate between strict and estrict due to the L1 Spanish phonotactic rule. However, the L1 Spanish speaker’s behavior is due to a rule difference across languages and is not indicative of a disorder. Implications and future directions for the current research are discussed.']",01/01/2018,Communication Sciences and Disorders,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Freeman_northwestern_0163D_14078.pdf

On a per-case basis, infections caused by the marine bacterium Vibrio vulnificus are the most burdensome foodborne illness at $3.3 million/case. V. vulnificus-associated fatality rates are reported to exceed 50 percent. Yet, the bacterium’s major virulence factor and its relationship to foodborne infection remain poorly understood. As infection incidence climbs in conjunction with rising sea surface temperature, studies elucidating pathogenic mechanisms of V. vulnificus are increasingly critical. ', 'This study investigates the pathogenic mechanisms of V. vulnificus as mediated by its primary virulence factor, the Multifunctional Autoprocessing Repeats-in-Toxins (MARTX) toxin. The MARTX toxin, product of the rtxA1 gene, has been identified as the dominant secreted virulence factor in the intragastric mouse model of V. vulnificus infection. MARTX toxins are classified as repeats-in-toxins (RTX) family members by virtue of characteristic amino acid repeats at the protein C-terminus. MARTX toxins are further defined as a unique sub-family of RTX proteins possessing: 1) tandem amino acid repeats at the N-terminus; 2) a cysteine protease domain (CPD) for autoprocessing; and 3) a section of effector domains situated between N-terminal repeats and CPD. Functional roles for each toxin region have been previously postulated but only recently experimentally investigated. This study employs a combination of bacterial genetic manipulation, in vitro assays, and in vivo intragastric mouse infection. We demonstrate that the same native MARTX toxin effector domain repertoire that is dispensable for toxin secretion, toxin delivery to host cells, and cell lysis in vitro is essential for induction of rapid intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction, bacterial dissemination from the mouse intestine, and anti-phagocytosis activity against macrophages. Moreover, the MARTX toxin effector domain repertoire is essential for bacterial virulence potential. ', 'We also investigate roles for individual effector domains within the larger repertoire. Each of the five investigated MARTX effector domains exhibit functional redundancy in the ability to disrupt phagocytic activity and intestinal barrier integrity. However, individual domains confer different virulence potential. This is demonstrated by altered survival outcomes of mice infected with strains harboring deletions in discrete effector domains. Together our results support a model in which the MARTX toxin repeat regions and CPD together function as a delivery platform for diverse effector cargo that define toxin potency and directly impact V. vulnificus virulence potential in mammalian hosts.']",01/01/2018,Driskill Graduate Training Program in Life Sciences,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Gavin_northwestern_0163D_14108.pdf

In particular, interactions with the cell or bacterial membrane, cellular uptake, and intracellular localization and processing are investigated using a library of graphene oxide (GO) nanomaterials. By systematically varying GO surface oxidation and lateral size, we successfully deduce the toxicological mechanisms in mammalian and bacterial systems.', 'Next, the environmental fate of GO nanomaterials is studied by measuring the influence of pH, ionic strength, ion valence, and presence of natural organic matter (NOM) on the aggregation and stability of GO nanomaterials in aquatic environments. A similar library of GO nanomaterials is used to determine the influence of surface oxidation on both the aggregation as well as the chemical degradation under direct sunlight. Based on the observed interactions of GO with NOM, the antifouling properties of GO are investigated by observing the deposition kinetics of bacteria and NOM. Based on our findings with GO, we further expand our studies to other 2D materials, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). The attachment efficiency of foulants on both 2D-nanomaterial functionalized surfaces is significantly lower than that of a control polymer surface, encouraging the potential use of GO and MoS2 for antifouling water filtration membrane technologies.', 'The environmental instability of black phosphorus (BP), a 2D layered nanomaterial which decomposes in the presence of oxygen and water, is studied in detail to encourage the development biodegradable constructs for a wide range of biomedical applications.

Furthermore, the stability of the BP dispersions is investigated in biologically relevant media; environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen, temperature, and ionic strength are considered for their role in the stability of the BP nanosheets. These results will enable improved efficacy and lifetime of potential BP constructs for biomedical applications, as well as provide a foundation for investigating the biological impact of these nanomaterials.

These robust, free-standing constructs can have high solids content while maintaining their mechanical intergrity when flexed and stretched. Furthermore, the presence of hBN within the matrix results in enhanced thermal conductivity. The high cytocompatibility of these constructs makes them potentially suitable for use in the field of printed bioelectronics.

22,Being Generative: The Motivations of the Generative Individual and their Associations with Well-Being in Midlife Adulthood,"(None, 'Jen', None, 'Guo')","Agency, Communion, Generativity, Life Story, Narrative, Well-being",In Copyright,"['There has long been an interest in the idea of generativity – the concern for and commitment towards promoting the well-being of future generations. In Western societies, generativity can be characterized through societal contributions and acts dedicated towards others. Since the early 1960s, when Erikson proposed generativity as the major developmental stage of midlife adulthood, evidence has accumulated showing many benefits for those characterized as being generative. Positive associations with high levels of generativity include strong motivational inclinations towards public service, better mental health measures, and self-reported psychological well-being. That is to say, highly generative people seem to be able to create positivity for those around them and for themselves. This has given rise to an interest in understanding the motivations behind the generative individual’s commitment towards generating positive change, and how, in spite of the many possible challenges associated with those commitments, generative people are able to maintain high levels of well-being.', 'To understand the generative individual, personality researchers have examined the qualities which make up ‘hallmark’ characteristics of generativity. In addition to assessing traits, a particular stream of personality research has been focused on analyzing the content within the autobiographical life narratives of generative people. By examining these autobiographical accounts, a person’s narrative identity – their personality relayed through the subjective reconstruction of the past, acknowledgement of the present, and projections into the future – may be understood. As individuals reside within the context of a sociocultural world, each person’s subjective interpretations of lived experiences can be especially revealing of how they make meaning from significant events. For instance, recent research suggests that highly generative midlife adults tend to construe their lives following a prototypical narrative called the redemptive self, wherein a gifted protagonist with steadfast moral principles overcomes suffering to make a positive contribution within society. However, what has not been examined in full are the motivational qualities which emerge within the narratives of highly generative people. ', 'Two central motivational themes have been argued to be the basic modes by which individuals relate to their social worlds and seek fulfillment in human living – agency and communion. The first theme, agency, refers to the motivational striving towards self-mastery, status, achievement, and empowerment. Somewhat orthogonal to this first theme, then, is the second motivational theme of communion. Communion encompasses the psychosocial concerns regarding affiliation, shared intimacy, relational support, and interpersonal dialogue. The use of agentic imagery in life narratives has been positively associated with clinical improvements to psychological well-being and health, whereas communion imagery has been linked to positive relationships with others and a deeper sense of purpose in life. As fundamental motivational themes, narratives rich in agency and communion may respectively provide for the individual an internalized private source of psychological support, as well as a sense of social connection to and integration within public domains. Yet agency and communion narratives’ relationship to generativity and how each of these measures play into longitudinal predictions of well-being over midlife adulthood remains unclear.', 'To address these questions, this project reports on data collected between 2008-2017 as part of a 9-year longitudinal study of 163 late-midlife adults in Chicago. At baseline visit, participants were given a structured life narrative interview, with agency and communion coded at 3 life story scenes: high point, low point, and turning point. Additionally, participants were asked to fill out an extensive, annual, self-report questionnaire including assessments for demographic information, generativity, psychological well-being, social well-being, and physical quality of life. A summary score for successful midlife adult aging was constructed using the average of their standardized scores for the latter four variables. Using growth curve analyses, changes to psychological, social, and physical well-being were modeled using self-reported generativity, coded thematic agency, and coded thematic communion as predictors. ', 'Observed results affirmed a number of this project’s seven main sets of hypotheses. First, in examining the construct of generativity, this project had partial evidence suggesting that the structure of self-reported generativity scores fell into latent dimensions of promoting the well-being of others and actively influencing others’ well-being (i.e., “getting along and getting ahead”). Second, beyond its concurrent positive relationship to well-being, self-reported generativity was associated with longitudinal increases in well-being over the course of mid-late life adulthood. Third, self-reported generativity was positively associated with the usage of thematic agency (but not communion) in individuals’ life stories. Fourth, thematic agency was positively correlated with psychological well-being, while thematic communion was not significantly correlated with social well-being. Fifth, narratives assessed to be high in thematic agency (but not communion) was associated with successful midlife aging, summarized using those measures of generativity, psychological well-being, social well-being, and physical quality of life. Sixth, narratives rich in thematic agency were not found to be associated with longitudinal increases in psychological well-being. Lastly, narratives rich in thematic communion were not confirmed to be associated with increases in social well-being over the period of mid-late life adulthood.']",01/01/2018,Psychology,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Guo_northwestern_0163D_14068.pdf

How do parents navigate this transition and mediate their tween’s technology as they progress toward greater autonomy and independence? How do their mediation strategies evolve during this time? Additionally, although pre-adolescent children are engaging in more social opportunities with technology, they are limited in their ability to consider the perspectives of others and may be engaging in social interactions online with limited capacities for fully understanding how their content may be received by others (e.g., Piaget, 1952; Selman, 1980).  How aware are they of others online? Who (if anyone) do they imagine when they share content in social media or engage in multiplayer games? Based on in-depth interviews with 40 parents and their 11- to 12-year-olds, this dissertation employed a grounded theory approach and examined various mediation strategies used among families of tweens as parents and tweens negotiate their expanding use of technology and digital media. Additionally, this study explored tweens’ experiences with their imagined audiences across various online contexts and examined the ways in which parents shaped such experiences.', 'While findings from this study supported previous work identifying restrictive and active mediation strategies, co-use, participatory learning, and deference, results also revealed more diverse, refined practices (or sub-categories) within these categories and the evolution of such practices as parents aimed to support the development of their tweens’ autonomy. In the service of promoting openness and trust between themselves and their tweens, parents began relying on more covert and reactive practices, rather than overt or proactive practices. Parents sought to monitor their child’s technology use more unobtrusively and engaged in reactive strategies, addressing problems and issues they were not able to anticipate. As parents encountered new challenges and adjusted their practices to accommodate their tweens’ growing independence, they felt overwhelmed and unsure of their mediation practices.  ', 'The exploratory nature of this study also allowed for the emergence of themes that have received little attention in parental mediation thus far. While research examining parental mediation practices has typically focused on the interplay of parental characteristics on such practices, findings from this study revealed that numerous child characteristics influence parents’ concerns and beliefs about the impact media has on their children, the ways in which children engage technology (such as the content they consume or share or the amount of time they seek to spend with technology), and the practices parents engage in to moderate such use. Influential child characteristics emerging from the data included child gender, perceived maturity level, perceived effects on child development or behavior, executive function abilities, sociability, and agreeableness or obedience. Rather than a unidirectional process in which parents socialize their children’s media experiences in a top-down approach, such findings demonstrate the transactional, bi-directional nature of parental mediation practices.', 'Finally, this dissertation explored tweens’ interactions with others across video sharing sites, multiplayer games, and social media. Tween decisions regarding privacy settings and whom they accepted as followers varied across contexts and account profiles, with such decisions made in the service of their goals for such sites. While most tweens maintained private accounts, not all tweens or parents were aware of the actual privacy settings (particularly parents of tweens with public accounts). Parents expected their children to know all of the individuals they accepted as friends online, but the concept of “knowing” someone differed among tweens and parents, with tweens commonly accepting requests from people they had not met as long as they shared one or more friends in common. When evaluating friend requests or making judgments about other individuals in online spaces, tweens heavily relied on concrete, perceptual features (such as images, profile names, spelling abilities, and the absence or presence of creepy or inappropriate content) to inform their decisions. Furthermore, age-related trends emerged with 12-year-olds being more likely than 11-year-olds to consider their imagined audiences, to reflect on their posts prior to sharing, and to acknowledge that information shared or available in the profiles of others may not necessarily be accurate or honest.']",01/01/2018,"Media, Technology and Society",Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,Hallongren_northwestern_0163D_14115.pdf

', 'We perform wide angle X-ray scattering measurements of perylene monoimide based nanoribbons, both in solution and deposited dry film, and develop formalism for interpreting obtained X-ray scattering patterns. This generally applicable method reproduces the measured diffraction patterns, including the asymmetric line-shapes for the Bragg reflections and yields the molecular packing arrangement within a 2D crystal structure and how it alters upon chemical modification of the constituting molecules. X-ray study of phase transition of n-propyl perylene monoimide nanostructure is discussed as well.   ', 'We used X-ray reflectivity technique to study the monolayer morphology of tetrathienoacene based dyes deposited on titanium dioxide surface. The latter serves as an electron channeling electrode in dye sensitized solar cells. Through atomic layer deposition a model surface of titanium oxide is fabricated, and organic dye monolayer deposited on it from organic solution. Analysis of X-ray reflectivity measurements expose the transformations monolayer films undergo upon alterations of backbone structure and modifications of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Alkyl chains are designed to prevent recombination and improve solubility. The results for molecular packing and molecular footprint correlate well with the measured efficiency and other characteristics of solar cells built with these dyes.', 'Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering was further used to determine orientation of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite films fabricated with a new deposition method. The analysis indexed all measured spots on the diffraction pattern which indicated high degree of crystallinity for these films and, crucially, perpendicular alignment of insulator organic spacer with respect to the electrode surface. 12.52% efficiency is achieved for this system with exceptionally high environmental stability, a major hurdle in utilizing perovskites in solar cells.', 'The same technique is applied in investigation of crystallinity of a blend of fluorinated and non-fluorinated small molecule donor compounds for bulk heterojunction solar cells. These molecules consist of benzodithiophene unit with two diketopyrrolopyrrole moieties. We show that 1:9 blend possesses highest degree of crystallinity. We attributed this effect to formation of C–H···F hydrogen bonding, which improves intermolecular connectivity and enhances photoconductivity. The 1:9 ratio also exhibits the highest efficiency in solar cells as compared to blends with other ratios of constituents.']",01/01/2018,Physics and Astronomy,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Harutyunyan_northwestern_0163D_14077.pdf

Remakes are provocative, postmodern engagements with classic texts. They not only rewrite the canonical texts but also problematize their extratextual legacy as cultural objects with accumulated meanings, interpretations, and preexisting histories of adaptation.', 'I conduct careful and contextualized analysis of eight play texts (dating from 1994 to 2013) and their most significant theatrical productions to understand how young Russians empower themselves through playwriting, rewrite their literary canon, and critique and contend with aspects of contemporary Russian life, from rigidifying gender norms to histories of trauma and war. My examination moves forward chronologically as it moves outward from plays that take on single source texts to those that take on the canon as a whole. Chapters 1 and 2 examine remakes of the novels Oblomov and Anna Karenina, respectively. Chapter 3 considers remakes of two novellas from a single author, Nikolai Gogol. Chapter 4, finally, investigates two plays that remake famous nineteenth-century plays, works that were already written for the stage. While the early chapters focus on how individual protagonists have been reimagined by contemporary playwrights, my later chapters turn to the question of the utility of and inherent meaning in the canon at large. ', 'I argue that these playwrights deconstruct canonical texts to lay claim to Russia’s literary heritage while also asserting the right to make meaning in a post-Soviet space. Moreover, in bringing these works to the stage, the playwrights lay the canonical texts and their own remakes bare for an ongoing process of meaning making, one that takes place through the encounter with the audience. If the Russian literary canon is inherently closed, its prescribed interpretations a product of the long Soviet years in which literature was coopted for its socializing and Sovietizing purposes, then the stage, in which meaning is never fixed, offers the canon its best possible antidote: in this site of living confrontation, these contemporary remakes wrench the canonical texts and the canon itself wide open.']",01/01/2018,Theatre and Drama,Dissertation,None,no embargo,HindsBond_northwestern_0163D_14103.pdf

With external disruptions and interventions (e.g., weather, special events, and incidents), from either nature or human beings, the dynamic traffic system has higher stochastic characteristics, a more complicated transition process, and unexpected hysteresis patterns. This study illustrates data-driven approaches to defining and characterizing traffic performance and conditions, addresses algorithmic problems associated with modeling and designing active management strategies, and evaluates and regulates the systematic parameters and sensitivity for predictive traffic management systems.', 'Operational conditions are derived from historical traffic system data to cover a wide range of traffic situations. This characterization and modeling procedure enables the design of strategies to achieve transformative mobility, safety, and environmental benefits in surface transportation systems management, as it accounts for any specific disruptions or interventions that may impact the traffic system.

I analyze performances of Indians on theatrical stages to define how an embodied repertoire of visual, aural, and kinetic markers, what I call the Stage Indian, became codified and circulated within popular theatrical performance. I discuss Edwin Forrest’s 1829 performance of the title role in Metamora; or, The Last of the Wampanoag to show how his claims to authenticity and his depiction of Native American identity worked to codify an Indian character in American theatre.  Buffalo Bill’s Wild West performance in 1886-1887 of The Drama of Civilization develops the Stage Indian further by modifying it based on the Native American performers it employed in the Indian roles and the mythic narrative of American progress it tells. The career of Will Rogers illustrates the persistence and power of the Stage Indian by showing an opposite example, a Native American who, though continually claiming Cherokee identity, was repeatedly and insistently read as white. I further explore the construction of the Indian within the United States by analyzing the creation and implementation of two landmark federal Indian laws. The 1830 Indian Removal Act and a resultant treaty, the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, demonstrate the narrow political and racial criteria the U.S. government expected from Indians as well as how Native American self-conception challenged those expectations. The 1887 General Allotment Act and records of allotment registration show how race and politics are twin foundations of Indian identity in the United States. Through my analyses of aesthetic and legal performances of Indianness I contribute to conversations of racialized performance in the United States, Native American identity, and the performativity of the law.']",01/01/2018,Theatre and Drama,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,Hughes_northwestern_0163D_14113.pdf

B.', None, 'Hunter')",Theater,In Copyright,"[""People want to be part of well-known, culturally significant stories, but not necessarily as actors. An important but overlooked dimension of spectatorship is participating meaningfully in a performed canonical story as an audience member, aware of one's position as such and also performing as the audience. Existing theory does not explain productions that foreground the relationship between participation and a purported authenticity to a canonical work. To date, meaningful participation has been measured by the audience's ability to affect a given story's outcome. But an audience who could change the narrative of a staged canonical text would disrupt its authenticity. Macbeth is not Shakespeare's Macbeth if the audience can save Banquo. So how can a production offer meaningful interactivity and still be authentic to a canonical work? "", 'This dissertation maps a new critical model the author calls ""enactive spectatorship."" By analyzing four contemporary Shakespearean productions that are interactive and assert authenticity, the author demonstrates how specific, consistent production choices devalue narrative impact as legitimate participation and replace this currency with the production\'s own reward system, thereby reconfiguring what ""counts"" as meaningful. The rewards that drive this system incentivize audience members to enact a recognizable role, the function of which is to endorse the production as authentic. This endorsement in turn serves to affirm the producers\' vision for the role of theatre in the twenty-first century.

The project outlines four discrete but mutually informing categories of production choice, from which practitioners will be able to derive a practical guide book. And as enactive spectatorship can be seen in scenarios from Shakespeare's plays to Disney theme parks, critical theorists who consider participation in a range of contexts may find this lens helpful for revealing the agendas that often underlie interactive productions and the reward systems producers use to promote audience compliance.""]",01/01/2018,Theatre and Drama,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,Hunter_northwestern_0163D_14120.pdf

This dissertation challenges these ideas and demonstrates some of the myriad ways Mexican migrants have historically helped shape New Orleans’ distinct culture and its economy. In order to understand the precarious and ever-changing position of what it has meant to be Mexican in New Orleans, this dissertation asks how Mexican migrants went from being socially excluded and racialized as non-white “others” throughout most of the nineteenth-century to gaining a degree of acceptance as socially and culturally white at the century’s end despite the city’s intensifying race relations. ', 'To answer this question, this dissertation examines Mexico’s relationship to New Orleans in the nineteenth-century, the stakes involved for both Mexico and New Orleans at the 1884 World’s Fair, the popularity of Mexico’s Eighth Cavalry Band at the Fair, and the lives the band’s musicians created for themselves in the city after the Fair closed its doors. It reveals that Mexico and New Orleans were connected through the circulation of goods, people, and ideas throughout most of the nineteenth-century, and beginning with the 1884 World’s Fair, Mexican diplomats and white New Orleanian leaders intentionally used cultural exchange and a “rhetoric of friendship” to reconcile past tensions between them and foster friendly relations as a strategy for advancing their own economic interests in the pursuit of modernity. The unintended result was the development of New Orleans’ relatively small, but culturally significant community that helped shaped the city’s distinct music culture and inadvertently helped forge a rigid color line in a city that had once been known for its racial fluidity.', 'The project unfolds in a specific place and occurs at a particular historical moment – the 1884 World’s Fair in New Orleans – and argues that it fundamentally changed the relationship between New Orleans and Mexico and created new opportunities for Mexican musicians in the process. Both white New Orleanian and Mexican leaders utilized the fair as an international stage where they could showcase their ability to be leaders in modernity in a quickly expanding world economy. While the fair was ultimately a financial failure and has largely been overlooked by scholars, Mexico’s Eighth Cavalry Band became its most enduring cultural legacy. The band’s musicians had been sent as cultural brokers who used music to translate cultural differences and language barriers, giving a cultural sound to the fair’s rhetoric. They emphasized a modern Mexicanidad and Mexican music as culturally modern and therefore “white” but foreign and “exotic” enough to appeal to white New Orleanian desires to experience a different culture while still allowing them to maintain their distance from the music’s blackness since it was performed by representatives of the “sister republic.” The band set off a popular craze for Mexican music and bolstered an intense local curiosity about Mexico and its people. Through examining this untold story, this project demonstrates how New Orleans and Mexico were intimately linked through the circulation of capital, culture, and actors in the late nineteenth-century, exposing the Crescent City as an unexamined U.S. – Mexican borderland.']",01/01/2018,History,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,JimxE9nez_northwestern_0163D_14071.pdf

Each of the chapters corresponds to a paper that studies topics related to program and treatment effects, which has been the subject of research in econometric theory and empirical applied microeconomics.', ""The first chapter is a paper that studies identification of program effects in settings with latent choice sets. Here, by latent choice sets, I mean the unobserved heterogeneity that arises when the choice set from which the agent selects treatment is heterogeneous and unobserved by the researcher. The analysis is developed in the context of the Head Start Impact Study, a social experiment designed to evaluate preschools as part of Head Start, the largest early childhood education program in the United States. In this setting, resource constraints limit preschool slots to only a few eligible children through an assignment mechanism that is not observed in the data, which in turn introduces unobserved heterogeneity in the child's choice set of care settings. I propose a nonparametric model that explicitly accounts for latent choice sets in the care setting enrollment decision. In this model, I study various parameters that evaluate Head Start in terms of policies that mandate enrollment and also those that allow voluntary enrollment into Head Start. I show that the identified set for these parameters given the information provided by the study and by various institutional details of the setting can be constructed using a linear programming method. Applying the developed analysis, I find that a significant proportion of parents voluntarily enroll their children into Head Start if provided access and that Head Start is effective in terms of improving short-term test scores across multiple policy dimensions."", 'The second chapter is a paper that is joint work with Ivan A. Canay and is forthcoming in the \\emph{The Review of Economic Studies} - see \\cite{canay/kamat:17}. Here we study a question of statistical testing in the regression discontinuity design. In the regression discontinuity design, it is common practice to assess the credibility of the design by testing whether the means of baseline covariates do not change at the cutoff (or threshold) of the running variable. This practice is partly motivated by the \\emph{stronger} implication derived by \\cite{lee:08}, who showed that under certain conditions the distribution of baseline covariates in the RDD must be continuous at the cutoff. We propose a permutation test based on the so-called induced ordered statistics for the null hypothesis of continuity of the distribution of baseline covariates at the cutoff; and introduce a novel asymptotic framework to analyze its properties. The asymptotic framework is intended to approximate a \\emph{small} sample phenomenon: even though the total number $n$ of observations may be large, the number of \\emph{effective} observations local to the cutoff is often small. Thus, while traditional asymptotics in RDD require a growing number of observations local to the cutoff as $n\\to \\infty$, our framework keeps the number $q$ of observations local to the cutoff \\emph{fixed} as $n\\to \\infty$. The new test is easy to implement, asymptotically valid under weak conditions, exhibits finite sample validity under stronger conditions than those needed for its asymptotic validity, and has favorable power properties relative to tests based on means. In a simulation study, we find that the new test controls size remarkably well across designs. We then use our test to evaluate the plausibility of the design in \\cite{lee:08}, a well-known application of the RDD to study incumbency advantage.', 'The third chapter is a paper that is forthcoming in \\emph{Econometric Theory} - see \\cite{kamat:17}. Here I study the validity of nonparametric tests used in the regression discontinuity design. The null hypothesis of interest is that the average treatment effect at the threshold in the so-called sharp design equals a pre-specified value. I first show that, under assumptions used in the majority of the literature, for \\emph{any} test the power against any alternative is bounded above by its size. This result implies that, under these assumptions, any test with nontrivial power will exhibit size distortions. I next provide a sufficient strengthening of the standard assumptions under which I show that a version of a test suggested in \\cite{CCT14} can control limiting size.']",01/01/2018,Economics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Kamat_northwestern_0163D_14123.pdf

DP is often mutated in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC), an inherited disorder that is a frequent cause of sudden cardiac death. The disease progression of AC is characterized by cardiomyocyte cell death and replacement of the healthy myocardium by fibro-fatty deposits. Furthermore, AC patients display contractility and conduction defects that can eventually result in sudden cardiac death.', 'Gap junctions, comprised of connexin (Cx) molecules are specialized intercellular channels that are indispensable in the myocardium where they coordinate the propagation of electrical signals between cardiomyocytes. Here, we elucidate a mechanism by which DP regulates Cx43 expression levels. DP loss was found to cause robust activation of ERK1/2 MAPK. Analysis of Cx43 phospho-sites in DP-deficient cardiomyocytes revealed an increase in MAPK sites S279/282, previously shown to signal internalization and degradation of Cx43. RNA-sequencing revealed Ras-GTPases as candidates for DP-dependent activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway. Using a novel reagent (RRSP) that cleaves Ras, we showed a restoration of Cx43 loss in DP-deficient cardiomyocytes. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for the regulation of Cx43 in cardiac disease caused by DP loss.', 'Loss of DP was also found to perturb the junctional localization and activation of RhoA GTPase signaling in cardiomyocytes. The small GTPase RhoA plays a fundamental role in regulating actomyosin contractility via its various downstream effectors. We identify that the Rho GEF Ect2, a functional regulator of RhoA activity, is a novel interacting partner of DP at cardiac cell junctions. We demonstrate that DP is required for the localization of Ect2 to cardiac cell junctions and that Ect2’s activation is dependent upon DP’s ability to scaffold the kinase PKCα at the cell membrane to specifically phosphorylate Ect2. Depletion of either DP or Ect2 leads to defects in actomyosin driven contractility of cardiomyocytes, providing a plausible mechanism for contractility defects observed in AC patients.', 'Finally, we investigated Plakophilin-2 (PKP2), a desmosome component that is critical for DP expression and localization in cardiac cells, and its role in promoting fibrotic signaling pathways in cardiac cells. Loss of PKP2 led to the activation of TGF-β (a known activator of fibrosis) as well as increases in transcript levels of various downstream pro fibrotic signaling components. This activation of TGF-β signaling by PKP2 was found to be a byproduct of DP loss as PKP2 depletion resulted in the destabilization and degradation of DP. Together our collective results indicate that DP is a crucial regulator of cardiomyocyte homeostasis and that its loss can lead to severe cardiac outcomes such as AC.']",01/01/2018,Driskill Graduate Training Program in Life Sciences,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Kam_northwestern_0163D_14092.pdf

In 2015, Chicago and Oakland both enacted two of the largest minimum wage increases of any major cities, from $8.25 to $10.00 and from $9.00 to $12.25, respectively. Adopting insights from economic sociology, theories of organizations, the sociology of work, and labor economics, I draw on these cases to argue that minimum wage increases reveal the embeddedness of wages and wage hierarchies within organizations. In contrast to expectations from the literature that businesses would seek to minimize their labor costs under these new policies, I find that restaurants enacted substantial non-mandated raises for most of their workers, raising them above new minimum wage levels. I argue that these “ripple effects” reflect the maintenance of wage hierarches that are central to workplace management in restaurants and other small businesses.', 'This dissertation uses a systematic sample of restaurant owners, managers, and workers in Chicago and Oakland restaurants, drawn 3 to 6 months after minimum wage increases, to assess how businesses respond to these policies. Semi-structured interviews with the respondents in this sample reveal both organizational structures and dynamics of change at a range of restaurants. In addition, analyses of Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics data describe the durable inequalities of the restaurant industry. Building on economic studies of minimum wage increases that find these policies to have positive or null effects on local economies, this work demonstrates that restaurants were able to effectively adapt to the higher labor costs imposed by raises. However, even as minimum wage increases addressed broader inequalities between industries, they did not mitigate existing inequalities in the industry deriving from job segregation by race and gender. By comparing these two cities, I demonstrate how the particulars of local institutions and policies shape the outcomes of minimum wage increases. This work highlights policy considerations for crafting minimum wage legislation to alleviate, rather than exacerbate, inequality.']",01/01/2018,Sociology,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 12/22/2018",Private,Knudsen_northwestern_0163D_14133.pdf

Designing advanced cathode materials and functional cathode coatings are two primary approaches to enhance the cathode performance currently. In this dissertation, various combinations of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and analytical tools are utilized to investigate advanced cathode materials and functional cathode coatings from both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. We first study the phase stability and structural evolution of novel high-capacity Li-rich layered cathode materials. We show that phase separation is energetically preferred relative to a solid solution at T=0K, and the coherency stain energy has little influence on phase stability. We investigate the delithiation process of Li2-xMnO3 (one critical component in Li-rich layered cathode) as a function of Li content. The structural transition from O3 to O1-type stacking sequence and oxygen release with Li extraction is predicted. Mn migration from Mn layer to Li layer is favorable both thermodynamically and kinetically in the delithiated O3 structure. This work helps to understand the structural discrepancy, capacity loss and voltage fade during cycling in Li-rich layered cathode materials. Beyond Li-rich layered cathodes, we systematically study the thermodynamics of ordering and phase separation in the ternary layered Li[NiCoMn]O2 system and quaternary spinel [LiVac][MnNi]2O4 system, which are the promising systems for advanced core-shell cathodes. In the layered Li[NiCoMn]O2 system, we construct binary and ternary phase diagrams as a function of temperature. In the quaternary spinel [LiVac][MnNi]2O4 system, we calculate quaternary phase diagrams as a function of temperature as well as voltage profiles of single ordered phases and multiphase composite structures. The computational strategy for multinary phase diagrams provides a pathway to understand and design novel core-shell battery cathode materials. At last, we focus on the study of functional cathode coatings for Li-ion battery.

A government that presides over an institutionally weak state might reasonably fear that an effective army would be tempted to engage in coup d’état. Yet several countries in Africa with low overall institutional capacity sustain armies with substantial material and organizational capabilities. Four countries meet these criteria and provide case studies for this research: Senegal, Uganda, Rwanda, and Ethiopia.', 'This study identifies the mainsprings of a sustainable weak state – strong army outcome in a combination of appropriate political strategies on the parts of state leaders that includes a willingness to repurpose informal “customary” social practices and institutions to compensate for weak bureaucratic structures of control. Coalitions of leaders inside and outside the military also collaborate in the deployment of armies to tasks that are not conventionally associated with militaries. Those that are successful in executing strategies enable the creation of ‘military enclaves’ where informal institutions and practices commonly associated with ineffective militaries in fact contribute to military effectiveness of that military. These findings point to a need for a new conceptualization of professionalism based on what type of military has emerged in a given state. Beyond conventional categories of political and apolitical armies, the particular nature of African politics and warfare has led to the existence of personalist armies. Personalized militaries exhibit their own traits – to include their own contextually dependent ideas about professionalism and military effectiveness. I argue that we need a model of institutional military effectiveness to establish the sort of civil-military relations that result in five different types of military outcomes: Ineffective, Resourceful, Parochial, Hollow, and Effective.', 'The capacity of weak states to build effective militaries in Africa indicates an alternative pathway for African state-building in a regional context in which interstate warfare is rare, foreign patrons provide selective security benefits, and leaders face apparent domestic incentives to keep armies weak.

39,Looking Good: Race and Cosmetic Surgery in Transnational Perspective,"(None, 'Alka', 'Vaid', 'Menon')","Asian, Cosmetic surgery, Ethnicity, Gender, Medical sociology, Race",In Copyright,"['This dissertation uses global cosmetic surgery to examine constructions of race, focusing especially on two multiethnic countries: the U.S. and Malaysia. The U.S. is the largest cosmetic surgery market and has historically been a center for cosmetic surgery training and technique, and Malaysia is a rapidly growing Southeast Asian country with a burgeoning domestic and cosmetic surgery tourist market. Adopting insights from gender studies, ethnic studies, and science and technology studies, I draw on these cases to argue that race and ethnicity take on particular salience in consumerist medicine as biological and sociocultural entities. In contrast to a prevalent concern in the sociology of science with the rebiologization of race in contemporary science and biomedicine, my work demonstrates that physicians continue to link race and culture. ', 'Analyzing cosmetic surgery as a transnational profession straddling medicine and the market, this dissertation shows how cosmetic surgeons draw upon cultural explanations for racial and ethnic difference in constructing standards for physical appearance. Acknowledging that race and gender are socially constructed facilitates cosmetic surgeons’ success in the transnational surgery market. To provide this analysis, the dissertation incorporates over 90 interviews with cosmetic surgeons, patients, and medical device vendors in the U.S. and Asia, as well as observations of cosmetic surgeons’ interactions with patients, observations of international cosmetic surgery meetings, and analyses of the content of cosmetic surgery procedural guides and patients’ online reviews. ', 'This work highlights the role of cosmetic surgeons as gatekeepers in defining possible interventions with respect to race, exploring the tension in cosmetic surgery between art and science, clinical judgment and standardization. Expansive and ambiguous definitions of racial and panethnic categories at different levels of practice—in the surgeons’ own biographies, in the clinic, in the nation, and in the transnational literature on cosmetic surgery—promote their spread and use. Such definitions lead to the racialization of physical bodies as well as surgical techniques, materials, and aesthetics. While cosmetic surgeons have made some effort to standardize practice through the development of ethnic-specific guidelines, this standardization is not totalizing. Rather, the use of race in cosmetic surgery showcases and depends upon the clinical judgment of individual cosmetic surgeons. Surgeons offer their own clinical experience accrued in distinct local contexts as an asset that differentiates them from their competitors. In addition, the cataloguing of racial difference promotes and justifies the proliferation of clinical practice variation in cosmetic surgery. ', 'This dissertation highlights the cultural production and valuation of different kinds of “ethnic” looks. In particular, the assertion of panethnic categories, like an “Asian” ideal, aligns cosmetic surgeons with distinct medical, cultural, and scientific trajectories, even as surgeons acknowledge significant heterogeneity within such categories. By including a focus on Malaysia alongside the U.S., this work shows how ostensibly universal, transnational notions of race in medicine manifest in distinct religious, economic, and cultural contexts. Rather than a story of the universal privileging of a “white” appearance, I trace the larger nationalist and regionalist dynamics at work in contemporary linkages of race and beauty in cosmetic surgery.']",01/01/2018,Sociology,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,Menon_northwestern_0163D_14086.pdf

Halprin, Rainer, and Dean’s models for choreographic transmission draw from the legacy methods of repertoire, reconstruction, and reperformance, while simultaneously proposing a new methodology that intentionally foregrounds the experience of loss and actively exposes historical layering. Anna Halprin’s use of dance scoring in the development and evolution of ""Parades and Changes"" (1965) presents a model for repurposing existing creative material in the creation of new performance works, a process of choreographic spolia that exposes Halprin’s aesthetic, philosophical, and cultural intentions in each instance of the dance’s reiteration. Similarly working to continuously recontextualize her work, Yvonne Rainer has variously employed and deployed her 1966 work ""Trio A"" as a choreographic fraction or insertable in her composite works and lecture-demonstrations, creating reflexive juxtapositions that elucidate her career intentions of challenging spectatorship. Rather than carrying her dance works into the future, Laura Dean draws from Tibetan Buddhist philosophy to advance a notion of dance as something to eventually be let go, actively foreclosing the possibility of restaging her work following her choice to authorially disengage from the process of choreographic transmission. Through the creative use of new notational practices, experimental processes for structuring performance, and strategies for archive formation, Halprin, Rainer, and Dean expose how the particularities of the present always inflect and inform the ongoingness of dance practice, thus ever reshaping our experience and embodiment of dance history. In addition to archival research, performance analysis, and interviews with the three subjects of this study, in this project I engage my own body as an investigative tool, myself participating in the dance work of Halprin and Rainer. I locate my own positionality within the history of these choreographers’ work, recognizing the ways my subjectivity contributes to the articulation and mobilization of choreographic legacy.']",01/01/2018,Theatre and Drama,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Mercer_northwestern_0163D_14127.pdf
41,Characterizing Pathways for Joining STEM in College and Beyond,"(None, 'David', 'Isaac', 'Miller')",Psychology,In Copyright,"['Students often change majors during college, and most workers change jobs throughout their careers. Yet the diverse opportunities for entering natural science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields are often overlooked during college and beyond. This dissertation therefore analyzed four large nationally representative datasets to characterize the pathways for joining STEM among college students and workers from non-STEM backgrounds. ', 'My theoretical framework contrasts sharply with the popular “leaky pipeline” metaphor, which has often pervaded debates about STEM talent in the United States. Since the 1980s, this metaphor has focused attention on plugging “leaks” in the pipeline (i.e., increasing STEM persistence) but away from more comprehensive strategies for addressing workforce needs. I argue that educators, employers, and policymakers should instead think of a network of pathways along which students and workers can take different routes to STEM competence. This pathways metaphor provides novel ways for thinking about developing STEM talent. For instance, late entry points into STEM offer new opportunities for recruiting women, especially given the large pool of women who start college as a non-STEM major and graduate with non-STEM degrees.', 'Across two studies, my dissertation studied pathways for joining STEM in the transitions from (a) beginning of college to graduation and (b) college graduation to the workforce. Nearly one fifth of STEM graduates started college as a non-STEM major, and one fifth of college-educated STEM workers had no bachelor’s degree or higher in any STEM field. Analyses described joiners’ educational history and job characteristics, identified predictors of STEM joining, and estimated the national impact of further widening joining pathways.', 'Study 1 found that joiners had similar high school STEM preparation compared to so-called “leaks” in the STEM pipeline (i.e., students who went from STEM to non-STEM majors) but had weaker preparation than persisters (i.e., STEM graduates who started college in STEM). Nevertheless, compared to persisters, joiners achieved similar undergraduate success in terms of STEM course grades and rates of graduating college on time (i.e., within four years). Grades in introductory STEM courses strongly predicted STEM attrition but not STEM joining, indicating asymmetric pathways for leaving versus joining STEM. In contrast to grades, taking STEM courses early in college strongly predicted later earning of STEM bachelor’s degrees among initial non-STEM majors, even after controlling for many theoretically relevant covariates. Impact analyses also found that, compared to “plugging the leaky pipeline” for female STEM majors, closing gender gaps in STEM joining would more potently increase women’s representation among STEM graduates.', 'Study 2 studied pathways for joining the computing and engineering workforce among non-STEM college graduates. Results suggested that joiners used their non-STEM educational training by working on non-STEM job tasks such as finance and management at higher rates than persisters. Overall, pathways were far more open for joining the computing than engineering workforce. Careers in both these fields appeared to be unattractive to non-STEM graduates who valued benefitting society, consistent with common perceptions that STEM jobs lack career opportunities to help others. Impact analyses found that an additional 820,000 college graduates would have been computer scientists in 2015 if communally oriented workers had joined computing as often as other non-STEM graduates. Most of these additional computer scientists would have been women.', 'These results suggest new strategies for broadening participation in STEM. Based on Study 1, postsecondary educators and policymakers should evaluate how to facilitate STEM joining pathways by increasing the quality and quantity of STEM courses that non-STEM majors take early in college. Based on Study 2, employers should consider how to communicate to potential applicants, especially non-STEM graduates, that STEM careers offer ways to help others.']",01/01/2018,Psychology,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,Miller_northwestern_0163D_14106.pdf

Bringing together approaches in medical sociology, socio-legal studies, cultural sociology, and science and technology studies, I analyze the SAMFE as a hybrid medico-legal object that joins law and medicine as a novel form of medical action. I draw on the method of “process tracing” to chart an historical sequence of events to explain a particular outcome: the joining of clinical medicine and criminal law in the SAMFE for the purposes of institutional reform and its effects in domestic and transnational contexts. I first examine reform initiatives led by early forensic nurses in the United States to combine specialized medical care and forensic evidence collection as a new standard of care. Their efforts suggest meso-level processes of legal mobilization in medicine to seek rights to healthcare and rights to justice for patient-victims through new medical routines. I use citation patterns to demonstrate the influence of U.S. forensic nursing models on international guidelines. I then follow these models into a contemporary global initiative to facilitate prosecution of rape as a war crime. After connecting the domestic and humanitarian contexts through the transnational trajectory of the exam, I then, analytically, separate them in order to compare and contrast the impacts and ethical concerns that arise in each context. Combining archival research, fieldwork at international meetings, and over 40 in-depth interviews of healthcare practitioners, activists, lawyers, and other experts, I argue that medical evidence collection techniques help to define what they purport to measure, thereby having profound symbolic and material effects on the credibility of victims’ narratives, which crimes are deemed justiciable, and ultimately how events come to be remembered. The case demonstrates how the interweaving of medicine and law gives rise to new forms of institutional hybridity, emergent practices, and methods of knowledge production that fundamentally reshape the patient-provider encounter.']",01/01/2018,Sociology,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,Morse_northwestern_0163D_14098.pdf

But convent education also differed in fundamental ways from other sources of education because it allowed lifelong intellectual exploration within a community of women. Convents valued reading and writing as ways to develop the intellect and the spirit simultaneously, while also sometimes allowing creative expression through theater. As a result, women could pursue intellectual enrichment throughout their lives and some used the opportunity to advance feminist arguments.

44,Understanding Supported Copper Oxide Catalysts for Cyclohexane Oxidative Dehydrogenation,"(None, 'Scott', None, 'Nauert')","Copper, Heterogeneous Catalysis, Kinetics, Oxidative Dehydrogenation, Spectroscopy, Supported Catalyst",In Copyright,"['Supported metal oxides are an important class of heterogeneous catalysts active for many selective oxidation reactions including alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.  Attempts to develop fundamental structure-function relationships for supported metal oxide catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation have been challenging, with many conflicting reports in literature.  This has been in part due to the use of propane oxidation which, though industrially relevant, poses several challenges for gaining fundamental insights of oxidation pathways.  This dissertation seeks to develop a more fundamental understanding of how structural and electronic properties of supported copper oxide catalysts impact oxidation kinetics by oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-ODH pathways by utilizing cyclohexane as a model alkane for study. ', 'The first part of this thesis introduces supported copper oxide as an active alkane ODH catalyst and explores the sensitivity of cyclohexane reactivity to supported copper oxide catalyst design variables such as copper precursor, copper surface density, and the presence of alkali.  Characterization by UV-visible and x-ray absorption spectroscopies shows that copper oxide structure is a strong function of copper surface density and a weaker function of copper precursor.  The copper oxide structure has a modest impact on cyclohexane ODH activity, but it has no impact on the relative rates of aliphatic and allylic C—H bond activation.  By contrast, changing the electronic structure of the active metal oxide phase by addition of alkali or using vanadium instead of copper has a large impact on cyclohexane ODH selectivity.  Furthermore, this work identifies a previously unreported spectroscopic feature of Cu(I)/SiO2 catalysts at low copper loadings which is correlated with high catalytic activity.', 'The remainder of this thesis focuses on developing fundamental relationships between copper oxide structure, electronic properties, and the resulting cyclohexane reactivity.  Spectroscopic characterization of CuOx/SiO2 catalysts varying in average copper oxide domain size shows that intrinsic Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox activity increases as copper oxide domain size decreases which results in an increase in the intrinsic activity of copper oxide sites for cyclohexane oxidative dehydrogenation.  Moreover, a distinct, highly active copper site is identified and fully characterized by a combination of in-situ UV-visible, x-ray absorption, and resonant Raman studies combined with modeling by density functional theory.  All constraints imposed by these techniques identify this unique site as a mono(μ-oxo) Cu(II) dimer with copper situated in highly strained siloxane defect sites present in dehydroxylated silica which has implications for reactions beyond alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.  Next, the underlying cause of support effects in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation is explored.  We provide evidence that charge transfer between the support and copper oxide impacts the rates of C—H bond abstraction and COx formation pathways in the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane over supported copper oxide catalysts.  We experimentally relate the support surface Lewis acid strength, determined by alizarin dye adsorption studies, to changes in copper oxide valence electron density for nine supported copper oxide catalysts.  Model cyclohexane ODH reaction studies then systematically relate these changes in copper electronic structure with changes in the relative rates of aliphatic C—H bond abstraction, allylic C—H bond abstraction, and combustion by routes in which C—H bond activation is not kinetically relevant.  The structure-function relationships determined for supported copper oxide catalysts have important implications for rational design of supported metal oxide catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.']",01/01/2018,Chemical and Biological Engineering,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Nauert_northwestern_0163D_14131.pdf

46,Partnering with the Public: The Pursuit of ‘Audience Engagement’ in Journalism,"(None, 'Jacob', 'Lewis', 'Nelson')","audience engagement, ethnography, journalism, news audiences, news production",In Copyright,"['Journalism professionals and researchers have recently argued that newsrooms adopt “audience engagement” as one of their chief pursuits. This term has many interpretations that stem from one underlying belief: journalists better serve their audiences when they explicitly focus on how their audiences interact with and respond to the news in the first place. Yet those who hope to make audience engagement normative must overcome news industry confusion surrounding how engagement itself should be defined and measured. Their efforts therefore present an opportunity to learn how journalism is changing, who within the field has the power to change it, and why they believe it should change. This dissertation investigates two such efforts with ethnographic case studies of Hearken and City Bureau, organizations that aspire to make the audience a larger part of the news production process. An additional case study of The Chicago Tribune reveals how audience engagement advocates and legacy journalists differ in their assumptions about journalism and the public, and how they act on those differences. Although the staff of all three sites acknowledge that the news audience avoids political news, Tribune employees attribute this avoidance to a lack of audience interest, while those at City Bureau and Hearken attribute it to a lack of audience trust. This leads the Tribune to approach the news audience one way, and City Bureau and Hearken another. Drawing on Giddens’ structuration theory, I argue that the Tribune reproduces traditional notions of journalistic practice, while Hearken and City Bureau attempt to transform them. However, their attempts are constrained by the news industry’s structure for monitoring and responding to the marketplace – its market information regime – which privileges measures of audience size rather than audience engagement. As a result, Hearken and City Bureau are unable to quantify the value of audience engagement to other journalism stakeholders. Instead, they rely on appeals to intuition. Their initial success suggests that that many in journalism innately believe the profession should improve its relationship with the audience. More importantly, it shows that the gut feelings of individual agents can prove more powerful than the structures constraining them, at least during periods of institutional uncertainty. This dissertation therefore illustrates what the future of journalism might look like should an audience-focused approach to news production become the norm, and exposes the obstacles that may prevent such a transformation from occurring.']",01/01/2018,"Media, Technology and Society",Dissertation,None,no embargo,Nelson_northwestern_0163D_14114.pdf

In worldwide afforestation projects, the establishment of introduced trees in novel habitats has been shown to require ECM fungal associations. The process for these introduced trees to establish is complicated by evolutionary host-partner specificity and nutrient allocation strategies. In each experiment of this dissertation, colonization of native Pinus massoniana (MP) and introduced Pinus elliottii (SP) by ECM fungi was used along with morphological and molecular sampling methods to measure ECM community characteristics.', 'Chapter I investigates which sampling scenarios would best resolve and describe the ECM fungal communities using high throughput sequencing (HTS). The results indicated a) analyzing a ‘mock’ community of known taxa with HTS was important for determining operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering and setting OTU low abundance read filtering; b) sampling protocols (replications, etc.) could optimize the recovery of OTU richness, but the documentation of the effect on beta-diversity by prior effects (e.g. forest types of different hosts) was not influenced; and c) different sampling resources (in-growth bag vs. root tips) of ECM fungi revealed significant difference in recovered ECM fungal communities by HTS. ', 'In Chapter II, I examined ECM fungal communities and soil physio-chemical properties of both MP and SP forest across broad geographic ranges of south China.

', 'For Chapter III, I monitored the ECM fungal community succession on native and introduced pine seedlings through a reciprocal bioassay experiment, which incorporated the combinations of different soil environment and ECM fungal inoculum resources. I found that the early establishment of ECM fungi was differentiated by host seedling identity. This pattern was further elucidated in Chapter IV where ECM fungi communities associated with native MP versus introduced SP seedlings displayed different exoenyzme functions, and those functional groups highly correlated with host identity and nutrient status. ECM fungi were also important for co-adaptation of host trees grown in the local soil compared with those grown in novel combinations. This research suggests that host identity, especially of introduced tree species, should be addressed in woodland restoration projects, and that more work is necessary to determine how best to restore ECM communities and the nutrient cycling patterns in local ecosystems.']",01/01/2018,Plant Biology and Conversation,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Ning_northwestern_0163D_14079.pdf

My first chapter concerns the effect of daily school start times on academic achievement in Florida. Exploiting the sharp discontinuity in school start time relative to sunrise, I track children who move between schools on either side of the time zone boundary in Florida. Consistent with children's sleep schedules becoming later after entering puberty, I find that the benefits of later start times are concentrated among girls older than 12, and boys older than 10. I conclude that reordering start times so that elementary students started first, then middle school students followed by high school students would increase math achievement for high schoolers by 0.064 standard deviations and reading scores by 0.044 standard deviations without negatively impacting younger students or affecting the overall distribution of start times in each district."", ""My second chapter studies how to measure the quality of \\textit{categorization} workers --- judges, doctors, patent and benefits examiners --- who's job is to decide whether a case fits a given criteria. I call examiners who can perfectly rank cases according to their colleagues' understanding of the standard \\textit{consistent}, and show that in institutional settings where different examiners study the same case consistency is identified. This chapter has implications for the fundamental fairness of the justice system, by estimating the extent to which defendants sentences depend on the identity of the judge who makes the decision. It is also relevant for understanding potential biases in examiner-assignment instrumental variables research designs, which have become increasingly popular in economics over the past several years. I show that my method can quantify the extent to which the monotonicity assumption is violated, and the implications for estimating treatment effects. Using a sample of Canadian refugee judges, I find evidence of widespread differences in judges in how they rank claimants. Judges with the same overall approval rate disagree on the correct decision about 13\\% of the time, roughly halfway between being perfectly consistent, and flipping coins to make decisions. I find little evidence that this will induce very much bias in treatment effect estimates using examiner assignment designs, but find that marginal treatment effect estimates may be very biased."", ""Finally, my third chapter studies the effect of incarceration on the children of the incarcerated. Previous, correlational research has shown that the children of incarcerated individuals are very often incarcerated themselves. This may reflect either selection --- the children of the incarcerated are coming from a disadvantaged background in many ways that are observable and unobservable to the researcher --- or treatment --- parental incarceration actually \\textit{affects} child outcomes --- but pre-existing observational designs were unable to separate these two explanations. I study a natural experiment in Ohio, where the county courts randomly assign cases to judges. Judges differ in their propensity to incarcerate defendants, and I use this variation as an instrumental variable for incarceration. I find that parental incarceration \\textit{reduces} the likelihood of the child committing crimes or being incarcerated as an adult, with the reductions concentrated among children who's parent is a first time-defendant and accused of relatively minor crimes. I find similar effects for sibling incarceration, and conclude that incarceration of a family member increases the salience of punishment for children, reducing future criminality.""]",01/01/2018,Economics,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 12/22/2018",Private,Norris_northwestern_0163D_14101.pdf

The ability to synthesize these materials by design is one of the greatest challenges in materials science. Advances towards meeting this challenge will lead to discoveries in fields such as plasmonics, photonics, catalysis, and energy sciences. DNA-directed self assembly has emerged as a novel approach for generating nanoparticle superlattices, where nanoparticle ""atoms"" functionalized with a dense shell of DNA linkers, termed programmable atom equivalents (PAEs), are assembled into crystalline superlattices with tunable compositions, crystal symmetries, and lattice parameters. To bring the potential of this technique into real applications requires a deep understanding of the precise control of the spatial distribution and orientation of the nano-scale building blocks. Theoretical models and computer simulations can play an important role in the understanding of the assembly process over multiple length scales, and eventually predict various phase behaviours. This thesis studies DNA-directed nanoparticle assembly via multi-scale modeling and simulation. The original work can be divided into three parts:', '(i) DNA-directed assembly is a well developed approach in constructing desired nano-scale architectures, while E-beam lithography is widely utilized for high resolution nano-scale patterning. Recently, a new technique combining these two methods was developed to epitaxially grow DNA-mediated nanoparticle superlattices on patterned substrates with specific orientation and controllable sizes. However, defects were observed which restricted this technique from building large-scale superlattices for real applications. In order to optimize the epitaxial growth, we used molecular dynamics simulations to study the nature of the formation of these defects and further developed design rules to dramatically reduce defects. \t ', '(ii) efects play an important role in materials science. Like any solid in nature, superlattices can contain different kinds of structural defects, which significantly alter their physical properties. They may provide material advantages or disadvantages. Further development of these materials requires a deeper understanding and good control over structural defect formation. We used Monte Carlo simulations to conduct a systematic study of defect formation in epitaxial growth of nanoparticle superlattices at a much larger length scale. The simulations show two main results. First, structural defects have long range correlations and form one-dimensional clusters with an exponential length distribution. Second, these linear defects exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking and undergo a liquid crystal phase transition. Furthermore, we introduced a mean-field theoretical approach, which is in strong agreement with the simulation results. ', '(iii) In previous studies, we focused on spherical nanoparticle building blocks. However, non-spherical nanoparticles are ideal building blocks for self assembly into various functional nanomaterials due to their unique and anisotropic physical properties. With the advent of methods for preparing non-spherical building blocks, DNA-directed assembly of anisotropic nanoparticles has attracted the interest of both experimental and computational research. The challenge is how to assemble these anisotropic nanoparticles into required target structures to obtain desired properties. Here we conducted multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo simulations to study the DNA-directed assembly of tetrahedron nanoparticles. We observed quasicrystalline structures with five fold symmetry in the assemblies. Further, we demonstrated that icosahedral nanocages can be formed by truncated tetrahedron building blocks with specific preconfiguration.']",01/01/2018,Applied Physics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Pan_northwestern_0163D_14126.pdf

Despite these advancements, treatments for metastatic cancer remain relatively ineffective. Metastasis is coordinated by various types of “healthy” stromal cells in addition to the tumor cells themselves. This requires a means by which the tumor cells can communicate with stromal cells. Exosomes are 30-150 nm nanovesicles that function as the primary endogenous intercellular delivery vehicle. During cancer progression, cancer cells package pro-tumorigenic RNAs, proteins and DNA into exosomes and subsequently release them into circulation. After release, exosomes traffic to the sites of metastasis, prior to the arrival of circulating tumor cells, where they initiate phenotypic changes, notably immunosuppression, that support the colonization and survival of metastasis. Collectively, the microenvironment generated by these exosomes has been called the pre-metastatic niche. ', 'In this project, we were first interested in understanding the effects of exosomes released from non-metastatic cancer cells. It is well established that exosomes from aggressive cancer cells promote metastasis, but the functions of non-aggressive cancer cell exosomes are not understood. We discovered that exosomes from non-metastatic melanoma cells drive the expansion of a Ly6Clo monocyte population called patrolling monocytes (PMo). These monocytes trafficked to the metastatic sites where they cleared circulating tumor cells preventing metastasis formation in mouse models of melanoma. The expansion in the PMo population was stimulated by pigment epithelial derived factor (PEDF), a multifunctional anti-tumor protein carried in the exosomes of non-metastatic melanoma cells. Importantly, exosomes isolated from the serum of patients with primary melanoma that did not recur had higher PEDF content compared to exosomes from patients with highly aggressive metastasis. Ultimately, this study demonstrated that exosomes from non-metastatic tumors can carry triggers like PEDF that active innate immune responses against cancer preventing metastatic spread.', 'Additionally, due to the metastasis promoting functions of tumor exosomes, we were interested in developing a technology to specifically inhibit the uptake of cancer exosomes by target cells. Exosome uptake is dependent on cholesterol-rich lipid raft regions of the cell membrane. Our laboratory has developed high-density lipoprotein-like nanoparticles (HDL NP) that specifically efflux cholesterol from cells that express scavenger receptor-type B1 (SR-B1). By modulating cholesterol flux at lipid rafts, HDL NPs effectively inhibit the uptake of melanoma exosomes by multiple cell types that play important roles in the pre-metastatic niche including endothelial cells, macrophages and tumor cells themselves. This work provides a crucial step in developing a cancer therapy that functions by inhibiting the uptake of exosomes.     ', 'The development of HDL NPs led us to test their efficacy as a cancer therapeutic in a wide array of applications. We discovered that HDL NPs can function to inhibit metastasis independent of inhibiting exosome uptake, as well. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) promote tumor progression by suppressing T cell mediated clearance of cancer cells. We demonstrated that HDL NPs target SR-B1 expressed by MDSCs resulting in a significant inhibition of their suppressive activity. HDL NP treatment led to increased T cell proliferation and, most importantly, significantly reduced tumor growth, metastatic tumor burden, and increased survival due to an enhanced adaptive immunity. Overall, HDL NPs have the potential to be developed into a novel multifunctional immunotherapy that can inhibit the activity of MDSCs, as well as block the uptake of exosomes in SR-B1 expressing cells.']",01/01/2018,Driskill Graduate Training Program in Life Sciences,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Plebanek_northwestern_0163D_14097.pdf

53,Regulation of the Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein of Yersinia pestis,"(None, 'Jeremy', 'Todd Henry', 'Ritzert')","Crp, Glucose, Pestis, Pla, Plague, Yersinia",In Copyright,"['Ubiquitous in the environment are bacteria that have evolved to adapt to the environmental niches they colonize. To this end, bacteria sensory and signaling molecules are required for processing these extracellular changes within their environment into changes in gene expression. The plague-causing pathogen, Yersinia pestis, contains a repertoire of two-component systems, transcriptional regulators, and riboregulators that allow Y. pestis to transmit between fleas, mammals, and multiple tissue sites therein. Each of these environments is unique in the available nutrients and host defenses. Its closest evolutionary ancestor, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, is a gastrointestinal pathogen that is not associated with fatal disease. The close similarity of Y. pestis to Y. pseudotuberculosis allows for studying of the evolutionary changes that permitted Y. pestis to adapt to a new life cycle. The cyclic-AMP receptor protein, Crp, is a transcriptional regulator that is 100% identical between Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis. However, differences in regulation of the crp gene could change when Crp-regulated genes are activated or repressed. ', '\tOur previous work discovered that the small RNA chaperone, Hfq, is required for translation of Crp in Y. pestis. Hfq binds to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) to regulate gene expression. Hfq control of Crp protein levels is temperature- and species-dependent and suggests sRNAs are involved in regulating expression of crp. A transposon screen was employed to identify sRNAs controlling expression of crp at the post-transcriptional level. The screen identified putative sRNAs and the PmrAB two-component system as potential regulators of crp expression. Identifying the regulators of crp expression in Y. pestis may allow for understanding the species-specific differences in crp expression.', 'Y. pestis encounters environments that change as the disease progresses. During pneumonic plague, Y. pestis proliferates within the lungs consuming available glucose by 72 hours post-infection (hpi). Expression of the pla gene, a critical virulence factor required for disease progression and target of Crp, increases as glucose is depleted from the lungs. Crp is necessary for expression of pla, and high-resolution microscopy captured increased expression of crp within large biofilm-like structures in mouse-infected lungs. Deletion of the glucose specific transporter, ptsG, attenuates growth in the lung, prevents glucose depletion, and the induction of crp and pla expression. These findings provide the first, direct association between activation of catabolite-repressed genes in response to changes in available glucose during infection.', '\tAfter identifying increased expression of crp within biofilms in the absence of glucose, I sought to identify differentially expressed genes within planktonic and biofilm-grown cells in the presence and absence of glucose by RNA-sequencing. RNA was also sequenced from a ∆crp mutant of Y. pestis to identify Crp-regulated genes in Y. pestis. Carbon source and Crp had significant impacts on expression of genes in Y. pestis. Crp regulates the expression of hundreds of mRNA-encoding genes and dozens of sRNAs. Crp directly represses the quorum sensing regulator, ypeR, but there is no significant reduction in AHL production in Y. pestis ∆crp. In addition, Crp is required for growth of Y. pestis in multiple carbon sources. The information learned from RNA-sequencing will be valuable in understanding how Y. pestis adapts to growth in the biofilm state and identifying Crp-regulated genes.']",01/01/2018,Driskill Graduate Training Program in Life Sciences,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2019",Private,Ritzert_northwestern_0163D_14095.pdf
54,THE CONCEPT OF STIKHIIA IN MARINA TSVETAEVA’S POETRY AND ESSAYS,"(None, 'Max', None, 'Rosochinsky')","20th Century Russian Poetry, Marina Tsvetaeva, Russian Literature",In Copyright,"['In this dissertation, I argue that the locus of Tsvetaeva’s seemingly conflicted views about art and the criteria for its evaluation is the tension between the rational, ethical, and distinctively human in us, and the irrational spontaneous impulse. Tsvetaeva’s term for the irrational impulse is stikhiia, a force of nature that is characterized by a creative striving. Stikhiia, on Tsvetaeva’s view, is not unique to humans. Plants and animals are driven to grow and reproduce in virtue of the same force. But in humans stikhiia finds its unique expression due to the human possession of the faculty of the will. Insofar as humans come to be possessed by stikhiia, they experience an urge to reproduce, create, and dissolve in the larger “we” or a grand ideal. In her poetry and critical writings, Tsvetaeva examines different dimensions and expressions of stikhiia, from the revolutionary impulse that drives the masses, to erotic passion, to artistic creation, to all-embracing and indiscriminate motherly love. Yet stikhiia, on Tsvetaeva’s view, is not the only type of human motivation, and it would be misleading to characterize all human activity as stemming from this single source. Humans are also moved to act by principles they reflectively endorse, and can rule themselves in accordance with rationally adopted laws. On Tsvetaeva’s view, stikhiia and the rationally adopted principles and values can come into conflict. A work of art, she argued, is a result of a conflict in which the artist managed to maintain a balance between the two impulses through an act of will. Works that have been produced through an act of will alone are products of an uninspired craft. By contrast, those that have come into being through stikhiia that was not mastered by the artist’s will collapse into undisciplined mutterings and formless visions. As Tsvetaeva argues in her seminal essay “Искусство при Свете Совести” (“Art in the Light of Conscience, 1932”), a genuine work of art can only be produced by an artist who masters stikhiia through an act of will. ', 'In the opening chapter, I examine Tsvetaeva’s cycle “Лебединый Стан” (“The Demesne of the Swans,” 1917-1920). I show that in it Tsvetaeva raises a problem for herself as a poet: what is the poet’s role in the morally destitute time? Tsvetaeva’s narrator becomes increasingly self-conscious of the need to articulate her mission. On the one hand, she must be guided by the power and the sheer forcefulness of stikhiia, exemplified in the poems by the figure of the faceless and nameless masses, natural forces, and the vengeful God enacting obscure dark laws. On the other hand, she must be attuned to her inner ethical disposition, her conscience. While stikhiia is a source of inspiration, the force that gives her voice and elicits a response, a conscience would silence her, revealing her “singing” as inappropriate. Torn in this way, Tsvetaeva’s poetic narrator attempts to reconcile the tension by discovering an ethical dimension to her poetic project. Her mission, as an ethically minded poet, will be two-fold: to preserve an account of the virtues that are lost and forgotten in the revolutionary chaos; and to retain the memory of the virtuous defenders of the ordered world whose valor will be suppressed and distorted by the historical narrative of the morally indiscriminate victors. What inspired the poem is the inherently productive force of stikhiia; but it is equally important that stikhiia rages against something enduring and active. On my reconstruction of Tsvetaeva’s thinking, the poet is inspired by the tension that emerged between stikhiia and those that oppose it due to their rectitude and ability to stand their ground in the face of danger.  ', 'I go on to examine Tsvetaeva’s notoriously difficult and controversial essay “Искусство при Свете Совести” (1932). In this essay, Tsvetaeva argues that art is essentially amoral – even more radically, that great art “puts conscience to sleep.” Insofar as an artist is guided by her conscience, her artistic achievements will be limited and her creative powers compromised. Yet a close reading of Tsvetaeva’s typology of artists shows that she does not think that great art is necessarily immoral – indeed, that would be a counterfactual. So how can great art be compatible with the requirements of morality? Tsvetaeva’s lucid analysis reminds us that artists are human beings, and so are bound by the moral requirements appropriate to humans. Insofar as they are artists, they should not create from the requirements of their conscience; but their creation may conform, if they are lucky, to the demands that their conscience places on them as human persons. Tsvetaeva’s own self-conception in “Лебединый Стан,” in which she dealt with the tension between “poet” and “human being” implicitly, comes into sharper relief in the context of this later discussion: an artist may create poems that express or preserve ethical truths, but she cannot do it because she’s bound by moral duty, or by the voice of conscience. Once the poet makes an explicit attempt to meet the distinctively ethical demands, she becomes a chronicler (letopisets). Being a poet does not free a human being of her moral duties just as being a human being does not relieve a poet of a morally indiscriminate calling to create.', 'This leads me to focus on the dimension of stikhiia so central in Tsvetaeva’s poetry: erotic passion, and its power to inspire the artist to create her works. For Marina Tsvetaeva, both poet and lover are inspired by stikhiia. She thinks that a poet, insofar as she is a creator of works of art, is exempt from ethical considerations; yet she is ethically responsible insofar as she is a human being. An excellent artist may be an ethically failed individual, just as an ethically successful individual may destroy herself as an artist. Tsvetaeva’s perspective on erotic passion is structurally similar, and my next chapter focuses on the issue of erotic impulse and Tsvetaeva’s ultimate rejection of erotic desire as an authoritative ground for action. My reading suggests that on her view, a virtuoso lover may be an ethical failure; conversely, an ethically successful person may be a boring lover. Tsvetaeva experiments with different models for reconciling the tension between eros and art within stikhiia; and the conflict between stikhiia-driven phenomena (erotic urge, artistic impulse, the revolutionary impulse) and ethical requirements. On her considered view, art takes precedence over eros (as well as other expressions of stikhiia), and ethics takes precedence over all stikhiia-driven phenomena, including art. But even an ethically responsible individual may nevertheless be tempted to excuse herself from moral requirements by the promise of brute power that stikhiia gives.', 'I conclude the dissertation by attending to the types of love Marina Tsvetaeva finds less likely to be determined by stikhiia and thus compatible with ethical requirements, sometimes even enhancing the ethical tendencies: the ideals of maternal love, and the love between a teacher and a pupil. Traditional erotic love is ethically problematic, selfish, partial, and fleeting. It also threatens to destroy the artist by channeling all of the stikhiia-generated powers into the love-making. Because both art and love are essentially creative and aim at reproduction, they compete, thus leading to the extinguishing of the creative impulse. On the basis of Tsvetaeva’s 1929 poem “Перекоп” (“Perekop”), I examine her concept of “people’s compassion” (narodnoe sostradanie) and develop an analysis of compassionate love that must be universally extended to all victims of terrible events and precedes the ethically relevant distinctions between the fallen (such as ‘good’ and ‘bad,’ ‘right’ and ‘wrong’). The beloveds are loved without having done anything to earn the love, just in virtue of their vulnerability and humanness in the face of an impossible situation. This ultimate form of love as compassion and understanding leads Tsvetaeva to reconceive of her poetic mission in her later poetry. It is no longer limited to preserving the memory of worthy beloveds and ensuring their immortality and salvation in the work of art because of their inherent merits; the poet also has a duty to mourn all of the willing and unwitting victims of the terrible historical events, extending her love to all of the fallen as if they were equally entitled to it, and refusing to succumb to hate despite their crimes. The poet thus emerges not just as a history-maker and a truth-teller, but a specially selected moral agent whose burden it is to extend the gift of compassion and understanding to the worthy and the unworthy alike.']",01/01/2018,Slavic Languages and Literatures,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,Rosochinsky_northwestern_0163D_14069.pdf

Two of the papers analyze important challenges of policy interest that electricity markets are currently facing. The third paper studies the consequences of demand restrictions in drug markets.', 'The first chapter of my dissertation refers to a paper related to coal regulation. Regulations that provide incentives to firms to continue producing energy from traditional sources such as coal or nuclear are of policy interest primarily due to two important benefits. First, production from such sources ensures a stable supply, as energy produced from renewable sources can be intermittent. Second, production from such sources also ensures a demand for their respective inputs that can play a crucial role in local labor markets. Despite these benefits, delaying the closure of coal-based generation through these regulations may come with high costs to consumers and the environment. In this paper, I study the consequences of a Spanish regulation that incentivized coal production by providing capacity payments to some unprofitable coal power plants using domestic input. First, I show that the regulation reduced production from gas plants, which is a cleaner and more flexible technology, and increased equilibrium prices due to higher bids as regulated plants used more expensive inputs, i.e. domestic coal. Next, I propose an empirical framework to investigate different counterfactual scenarios. I show that an alternative policy design would have reduced consumer costs by 3.2% in comparison to the regulation. My results also demonstrate that total consumer costs also decrease when regulated plants retire and when renewable experiences a substantial negative shock. ', 'The second chapter is a paper that is joint work with Professor Mar Reguant and that evaluates external and internal costs of wind intermittency. The economics literature has focused on quantifying the marginal value of renewables by looking at their market value as a decrease on energy market price and environmental value as a reduction of emissions. However, variable renewable energy adds integration costs due to its intermittency that need to be accounted for to design the optimal generation mix. This paper analyzes the costs of wind intermittency in the context of the Iberian Electricity Market (IEM). Exploiting the market design of the IEM, we define two types of intermittency costs: external and internal. First, external costs are charged to final consumers as part of operational costs. Second, internal costs are accounted for by firms when making their decisions and they penalize last-minute imbalances. Using detailed data from the IEM, we empirically estimate the impact of wind generation and wind intermittency on external costs for different levels of wind integration. Moreover, we show that firms respond to penalties by reducing their deviations. Our paper demonstrates that both wind generation and wind intermittency have a positive average impact on external and internal costs. Therefore, failing to account for these integration costs overstates the marginal value of wind. ', 'Finally, the third chapter is a paper that studies the equilibrium effects of demand restrictions in the market for Hepatitis C drugs. A number of life saving yet prohibitively expensive drugs that target a large pool of potential consumers have recently entered the market. To control the costs of these drugs, state Medicaid agencies individually restrict their access to patients who are at the final stages of the disease. This paper solves a two-stage model to illustrate the equilibrium consequences of these demand restrictions. In the second stage, I construct a theoretical bargaining model between state Medicaid agencies and drug manufacturers to demonstrate how demand restrictions affect negotiated prices. Whereas, in the first stage, I provide a welfare criterion to how the Medicaid chooses these endogenous restrictions. Using Medicaid drug utilization data for the Hepatitis C virus drug and variation in restrictions across states, I then provide empirical evidence for some of the model implications for both stages.']",01/01/2018,Economics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,SeguraVaro_northwestern_0163D_14117.pdf

First for a multifingered hand with circle patch contacts, we present a framework for planning the motion of the hand to create an inertial load on the grasped object to achieve a desired in-grasp sliding motion.  The model of the sliding dynamics is based on a soft-finger limit surface contact model at each fingertip. A motion planner is derived to automatically solve for the finger motions for a given initial and desired configuration of the object relative to the fingers. Iterative planning and execution is shown to reduce errors that occur due to modeling and trajectory tracking errors. The framework is applied to the problem of regrasping a laminar object held in a pinch grasp. We propose a limit surface model of the contact pressure distribution at each finger to predict sliding directions. Experimental validations are shown, including iterative error reduction and repeatability of the experiment.', 'Secondly we study quasistatic in-hand sliding manipulation with spring-sliding compliant grasps. We focus on point-contact multi-fingered grasps and the goal is to achieve object regrasping by taking advantage of external contacts with the environment.

By controlling finger anchor motions the contact forces can be moved to the edges of friction cones and cause sliding to realize regrasping. External contacts provide forces that maintain object force balance during the motions. We model the contact and object mechanics for multi-fingered grasps in spatial cases and analyze robust conditions in terms of finger contact wrench uncertainties. Based on the modeling a general motion planning framework is proposed.

The first chapter explores when moral hazard in a principal-agent contract can lead to pareto improvements when it is preceeded by information gathering. The second chapter studies how product differentiation affects the amount of market research done by firms that compete on price. The third chapter examines the role of costly risk in a production process when there is a debt contract between an investor and an entrepreneur. ', ""In Chapter 1, I consider an agent who designs an experiment that reveals information about a state to a principal. The principal subsequently decides whether or not to implement a project. If she does, then she offers a limited-liability contract to motivate the agent to exert effort, which together with the state stochastically determines the project's output. If effort is contractible, the contract ``holds up'' the agent so that conditional on implementation his payoff is independent of the principal's beliefs. In equilibrium, he provides only enough information to maximize the probability that the principal implements the project. In contrast, if effort is non-contractible then the principal must promise the agent rent to motivate effort. Since the promised rent varies across beliefs, the agent may provide more precise information. Thus, although the non-contractibility of effort lowers the principal's payoff at a given belief, it can improve welfare by mitigating hold-up and encouraging information provision. "", 'In Chapter 2, I apply the main result in Persico (2000), that decision-makers acquire more information when their payoffs are more risk-sensitive, to a duopoly model of Bertrand competition with uncertain demand following Vives (1984) in order to show how the amount of private market research firms undertake depends on competition, measured as the level of product differentiation. I decompose the relative marginal return of research across competition levels into two effects, a competitive profit effect and a coordination effect, and show how each of these depends on competition. When the cost of market research is sufficiently high, the amount firms invest in market research is decreasing in the level of competition. In contrast, when the cost of market research is sufficiently low, firms perform the most market research at an intermediate level of competition. I partially extend this result to a public market research setting.', 'In Chapter 3, I extend a simple model of debt between a liquidity-constrained entrepreneur and an investor to allow one of the players, according to the governance structure, to choose either risky or safe production at time 1. Risky production causes capital to depreciate, lowering the value of collateral and production at time 2. When the entrepreneur is tempted to choose risky production in order to foreclose more often in the low state and less often in the high state, he must offer more collateral to the investor. In this way, his inability to commit to safe production can lower his expected value from the project in equilibrium. I provide necessary and sufficient conditions such that the entrepreneur strictly prefers for the investor to have governance over time 1 production in order to overcome this commitment problem.']",01/01/2018,Managerial Economics and Strategy,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Shopp_northwestern_0163D_14128.pdf
59,Developing Functional Optical Imaging Modalities to Study Retinal Diseases,"(None, 'Xiao', None, 'Shu')","Functional imaging, Ophthalmoscopy, Optical coherence tomography, Photoacoustic microscopy, Retinal pigment epithelium",In Copyright,"['Over the past few decades, functional imaging has received increasing attention from both research scientists and clinical practitioners. Compared to conventional imaging technologies, functional imaging modalities can provide the variations in chemical composition, absorption, blood flow and metabolism of biological tissue in addition to visualization of its structure. Information regarding these functional variations not only sheds light upon mechanisms of fundamental physiological processes, but also facilitates early detection of diseases. This dissertation seeks to develop functional imaging modalities for eye imaging, which, by providing enriched understanding of retinal pathophysiology, can ultimately lead to improved management of ocular diseases.', 'A number of well-established technologies can provide functional imaging of biological tissue. For example, positron emission tomography (PET) reveals tissue metabolism by imaging regional glucose uptake; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computed tomography (CT) perfusion imaging measure neural activity in brain by detecting changes in blood flow. However, with half-millimeter resolution, these imaging modalities cannot resolve the fine information in the retina. The retina is a light-sensitive layer of tissue and a part of central nervous system. It converts the light into nerve impulses and transmits the signal to visual cortex. Though containing several sub-layers with different functionalities in the visual preprocessing cascade, the total thickness of retina is only hundreds of micrometers. Evolved as the optical sensor of human body, the eye provides the light with unhindered access to retina through cornea, lens, aqueous humor and vitreous humor, which makes optical imaging suitable for retinal examination. In addition, optical imaging, in general, has micrometer-level resolution which is sufficient to resolve retinal structure. Although strong optical absorption and scattering of biological tissue diffuse the probing light beyond one-millimeter penetration depth and limit the application of optical imaging to most internal human organs, imaging the entire retina is well within its capabilities. Therefore, optical imaging is ideal for the examination of the retina.', 'Existing clinical retinal imaging modalities, such as fundus photography, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) and conventional optical coherence tomography (OCT) rely on structural variation of the retina to detect eye diseases. However, there is growing evidence suggesting that functional aberration may precede structural abnormalities in the leading blinding diseases. For example, loss of melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is both a risk factor and early symptom of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and measurement of optical absorption and melanin concentration can potentially lead to early detection and better monitoring of the disease. As another example, growing evidence suggests that in diabetic retinopathy (DR), the metabolic changes may reflect onset of the disease long before vascular structure aberration, and evaluation of retinal metabolism can bring medical intervention to an earlier stage.', 'In this dissertation, functional photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) is used to measure the melanin concentration in the RPE. PAM combines optical illumination with acoustic detection and is specific to optical absorption, or energy deposition, which is proportional to the concentration of optical absorbers. A Monte Carlo simulation is first performed to study the optical energy deposition in the retina and the generation of the photoacoustic (PA) signal. An intrinsic calibration scheme using PA signals of retinal blood vessel as reference is proposed to improve consistency across different measurements, different subjects, and different imaging systems. The simulation suggests that, though not required, a fine axial resolution that can distinguish RPE from underlying choroid, which also generates PA signal due to optical absorption, is preferred to increase the measurement sensitivity. Following the simulation, a high axial resolution PAM, enabled by a broadband ultrasonic detector based on a micro-ring resonator (MRR), is developed to measure the melanin concentration in ex vivo eye samples from pig and human. The exceptional 2.12-µm axial resolution allows separation of RPE from choroid and the melanin concentrations in both layers are quantified.', 'In addition to developing PAM for functional imaging of RPE melanin, this dissertation also represents a pioneering study that translates functional visible-light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT) from preliminary laboratory investigation to clinical applications. Instead of using conventional near-infrared (NIR) light sources, vis-OCT exploits the visible band of the electromagnetic spectrum, which not only improves axial resolution but also provides additional spectroscopic contrast to evaluate oxygen saturation of blood vessel and tissue metabolism. The first vis-OCT ophthalmoscope is developed for in vivo human eye imaging. Engineering design, and user friendliness of the initial prototype system are optimized continuously, which leads to improved imaging quality and provides a platform for retinal oximetry in human subjects.', 'Besides developing functional imaging platforms on the system level, efforts are also made to improve the imaging performance from algorithm and light source perspectives. A spectroscopic Doppler analysis method is proposed to extend the measurement range of flow velocity in blood vessels without phase wrapping correction, which may eventually facilitate metabolism measurement using vis-OCT. A fiber-based nanosecond-pulsed supercontinuum light source is developed to serve as a single light source for both functional PAM and OCT, which facilitates dual-modality applications.']",01/01/2018,Biomedical Engineering,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2019",Private,Shu_northwestern_0163D_14102.pdf

Owing to their light trapping and focusing ability, single nanoparticles can be utilized to efficiently drive chemical reactions at the sub-nanometer scale.  Much of the fundamental science regarding how plasmons can be harnessed to efficiently drive chemical dynamics remains not yet fully understood.  In this dissertation, we present the first direct detection of fundamental product (i.e. the radical anion) from a plasmon-driven electron transfer reaction.  The radical anion is created through intense illumination of the nanoparticle surface with visible light, causing electrons to transfer to a nearby adsorbate molecule.  The ionized species, or radical anion, is then directly detected using a form of vibrational spectroscopy known as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).  We demonstrate the plasmon-driven electron transfer effect across various molecular polypyridine complexes as well as provide a detailed description of the experimental energetics required to photo-initiate this reaction.  In addition, we carefully correlate chemical information with nanoparticle structure, optical, and electronic information using localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) scattering, spectrally-resolved polarization dependent SERS, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) on the same nanoscale entity.

61,Investigating Individual Differences in Implicit Learning,"(None, 'Kelsey', 'Rachel', 'Thompson')","Implicit Learning, Individual Differences, Sequence Learning",In Copyright,"['Memory systems research has established the importance of two distinct types of memory systems in the brain: explicit and implicit. While a robust literature exists on individual differences in the explicit domain (Chapter 3), research on individual differences in implicit learning remains relatively limited. The key question guiding the investigation into individual differences described in this dissertation lies in the arguably natural assumption that certain individuals are more equipped to learn particular skills, such as in sports or music, that are supported by implicit learning mechanisms. Historically, researchers have assumed that individual differences in implicit learning are relatively small or nonexistent due its reliance on evolutionarily older neural mechanisms and its incidental or “automatic” nature. Such an automatic process should not be able to translate into individual advantages or weaknesses in implicit learning. However, the body of research investigating “automaticity” in implicit learning has proved inconclusive in many ways.', 'Furthermore, researchers who study the types of real-world skill learning that implicit learning is thought to support have argued in favor of individual differences. In particular, consideration of the nature of skill expertise has led some to argue that innate talent does play an important role in skill learning. This suggests that implicit learning, as a key component of skill learning, may vary across individuals in a similar way to constructs with a much deeper history of individual differences research, such as fluid intelligence or working memory capacity. In other words, particular individuals may simply be more gifted when it comes to skill learning, a notion that likely seems logical or even obvious to most.', 'In my own research using an implicit sequence learning task, I have found that altering participants’ mental state (e.g., depleting mental resources, inducing a particular motivational state) can impact the expression of implicit knowledge, providing a firmer argument against the notion of “automaticity” in implicit learning (Chapter 2). In addition, other researchers have begun to investigate the relationship between individual differences in working memory capacity and individual differences in implicit learning (Chapter 3). Together, these studies led me to ask the question: is implicit learning ability a reliable trait measure that differs across individuals? Surprisingly, the results from the four experiments at the core of this dissertation (Chapter 4) suggest that the answer is a resounding no. Evidence from both correlational and factor analyses indicated that sequence-specific learning ability is not a stable individual trait. This finding adds significantly to the discussion of the nature of skilled expertise by implying that the basic implicit learning mechanism underlying skill learning is a universally shared process—all individuals have an equal capacity to learn.']",01/01/2018,Psychology,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Thompson_northwestern_0163D_14087.pdf
62,Molecular organization of EphA2 cell-cell communication complexes in human keratinocytes,"(None, 'Rosa', None, 'Ventrella')","Eph receptor, Ephrin, Keratinocyte, Lipid raft, Migration, Transmembrane domain",In Copyright,"['Erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular (Eph) receptors and their corresponding ephrin ligands are asymmetrically expressed at cell-cell contacts allowing for bidirectional signaling with forward signaling through the receptor expressing cell and reverse signaling through the ligand expressing cell. Eph receptors are the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in mammals, which allows for a vast array of signaling responses depending on which receptor and ligand are interacting and the cell type involved. In addition, when ephrin ligands are expressed on the same cell, Eph signaling is inhibited adding an additional mechanism of signal regulation. Most notably, Eph/ephrins have been shown to play important roles in cell sorting, boundary formation, and tissue morphogenesis. Misregulation of Eph/ephrins often lead to aberrant signaling pathways, leading to a variety of diseases. Specifically, in the epidermis, ephrin-A1 promotes keratinocyte differentiation and inhibits keratinocyte migration through EphA2. Alterations in this signaling axis is associated with inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and non-melanoma skin cancer. ', 'Ephrin-A1 contains a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked tail, which targets this ligand to specific membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts. Lipid raft domains are important for regulating the distribution of membrane proteins and are enriched in sterols, most notably cholesterol, making them thicker and less fluid than the surrounding membrane. Due to the importance of ephrin localization relative to its receptor, one would hypothesize that lipid rafts play an important role in the downstream signaling elicited by EphA2 and ephrin-A1; however, the ability of this receptor and ligand to localize to lipid raft domains and the mechanisms governing their localization patterns in keratinocytes is unknown. Additionally, due to the importance of EphA2 and ephrin-A1 in keratinocyte biology, it is likely that ephrin-A1 and EphA2 cellular distribution is important in controlling keratinocyte behaviors like differentiation and migration. ', 'In order to address these hypotheses, we used a combination of biochemical and imaging approaches to study the molecular organization of ephrin-A1 and EphA2 signaling complexes in a primary human keratinocyte culture model. We provide evidence that ephrin-A1-induced forward signaling promoted keratinocyte differentiation as assessed by tight junction proteins that are expressed during the final stages of epidermal differentiation. We also provide evidence that EphA2 is present in lipid raft domains along with ephrin-A1. The recruitment of EphA2 to lipid raft domains at cell-cell junctions was dependent on the unique properties of its transmembrane domain (TMD).  Swapping the EphA2 TMD with a shorter and molecularly distinct TMD of the highly homologous EphA1 caused failure of this transmembrane mutant chimera to localize to cell-cell contacts, likely affecting its interaction with ephrin-A1. Correspondingly, this chimera increased ephrin-A1 expression levels and impaired the ability of keratinocytes to efficiently seal linear scratch wounds in an ephrin-A1-dependent manner. However, this chimera had minimal impact on calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation. These findings suggest that cell-cell contact stabilization of EphA2 is not required to promote keratinocyte differentiation. Moreover, ephrin-A1 protein levels negatively regulate keratinocyte migration, but do not necessarily enhance keratinocyte migration. ', 'Collectively, these studies highlight a key role for the EphA2 TMD and its association with lipid rafts in modulating downstream signaling. Our data highlight the importance of EphA2 localization to lipid raft domains at cell-cell contacts in controlling ligand expression level. Specifically, these findings suggest the importance of the EphA2 TMD in regulating keratinocyte migration, which has relevance to cutaneous wound healing. These findings likely have broader implications for the understanding of Eph/ephrin and transmembrane receptor biology. It is likely that lipid rafts play important roles in organizing Eph/ephrin signaling networks at boundaries to control Eph/ephrin and other membrane receptor interactions that govern cell segregation and tissue patterning. In addition to modulating Eph/ephrin interactions, lipid rafts likely organize receptor crosstalk in different membrane regions. These discoveries will be important in understanding how lipid raft disruption or Eph/ephrin misregulation leads to abnormal signaling, resulting in loss of tissue homeostasis. Lastly, these outcomes show the significance of the TMD of RTKs in regulating downstream signaling pathways.']",01/01/2018,Driskill Graduate Training Program in Life Sciences,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Ventrella_northwestern_0163D_14083.pdf
63,The Impact of Type II Secretion on the Intracellular Lifecycles of Legionella pneumophila,"(None, 'Richard', 'Christopher', 'White')","Host-pathogen interaction, intracellular infection, Legionella pneumophila, Legionnaires' disease, Type II secretion",In Copyright,"['Previous work demonstrated that the type II secretion (T2S) system of Legionella pneumophila secreted at least 25 different proteins, several of which promote infection of protozoan hosts. In order to uncover new roles for T2S effector proteins during protozoan infection, I assessed gene expression during the intracellular replication phase of L. pneumophila. Genes encoding LapA, LapB, and PlaC were the most highly upregulated T2S genes during infection of Acanthamoeba castellanii, although these genes were thought dispensable on the basis of the behavior of mutants lacking either lapA and lapB or plaC. I determined that the role of the LapA/B aminopeptidase is compensatory to that of the PlaC acyltransferase. Hence, I made double mutants and found that lapA plaC mutants have a ~50-fold defect during infection of A. castellanii. These data revealed, for the first time, the importance of LapA in any sort of infection. I documented LapA’s activation by another T2S-dependent protease (ProA), and its broad substrate specificity. When the amoebal infection medium was supplemented with amino acids, the defect of the lapA plaC mutant was reversed, implying that LapA generates amino acids for nutrition. Based on past proteomic analysis, I began characterization of a novel secreted protein (NttD) that promotes infection of A. castellanii. A lapA plaC nttD mutant displayed an even greater (100-fold) defect, demonstrating that the LapA, PlaC, and NttD data largely explain the importance of T2S in L. pneumophila infection of amoebae. LapA-, PlaC-, and NttD-like proteins had distinct distribution patterns within and outside the Legionella genus. LapA was notable for having as its closest homologue an A. castellanii protein. To determine the extent to which these effectors promote intracellular replication, I utilized fluorescent L. pneumophila to monitor the intracellular compartment, and implicated ProA in late stages of replication, as opposed to the entire T2S system, which I documented is required for the onset of replication.', ""   Past work also documented that T2S promotes intracellular infection of macrophages. I sought to identify infection events that are modulated by T2S by comparing the behaviors of wild-type and T2S mutant bacteria in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and human U937 cells, to refine the role of T2S within macrophages. While T2S was dispensable for entry into the host cells and evasion of lysosomal fusion, T2S promoted the initiation of replication between 4 and 8 h postentry and was required for replication to large numbers within the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). At 4 h postinoculation, mutant LCVs had a significantly reduced association with Rab1B, a host GTPase that facilitates the tethering of endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles to LCVs. Interestingly, the mutant's growth defect was exacerbated in macrophages that had been depleted of Rab1B by short hairpin RNA treatment, indicating that T2S potentiates events beyond Rab1B association with the LCV. In support of a Rab1-independent role for T2S, a sidM lspF double mutant had an intracellular growth defect that was more dramatic than that of the lspF mutant (and a sidM mutant) and showed a growth difference up to 400-fold compared to the wild type. Together, these findings reveal a new role for T2S in intracellular infection that involves both Rab1B-dependent and Rab1B-independent processes.""]",01/01/2018,Driskill Graduate Training Program in Life Sciences,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,White_northwestern_0163D_14122.pdf

This dissertation applies a range of methodological techniques to fMRI data to better understand mood and anxiety disorders. In Chapter 1, we demonstrated the malleability of reward-related brain function, which has been shown to be aberrant in major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar spectrum disorders (BSD). More specifically, we showed that in healthy adults, positive mood enhances activity in reward-related brain regions specifically during reward anticipation. In Chapter 2, we examined brain activity and connectivity related to anhedonia, a core symptom of numerous psychiatric disorders. We showed that trait anhedonia in healthy adults is negatively associated with activation in brain regions involved in processing reward and salient emotional stimuli. We also used psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis to show that trait anhedonia is associated with reduced connectivity of mesolimbic, and related limbic and paralimbic networks involved in reward processing. In Chapter 3, we demonstrated that anhedonia in MDD is associated with context-specific deficits in posterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity with the reward network when encountering pleasurable stimuli, rather than a static deficit in intrinsic resting-state connectivity. Analyses for this study included generalized PPI and seed-based resting-state connectivity. In Chapter 4, we developed a novel method to assess how connectivity changes as a function of stress and arousal in healthy adults. Here, we showed that the salience network is able to optimally engage the executive control network to coordinate cognitive activity at moderate levels of arousal, but is unable to do so at high levels of arousal and stress. Finally, in Chapter 5 we examined BSD, high-risk, and healthy control adults, and used machine learning to predict reward/loss versus intrinsic brain states based on features of large-scale brain networks. In addition to achieving classification accuracies above 83%, we showed that the discriminability of reward/loss versus intrinsic brain states was related to self-report measures of reward sensitivity. Overall, this dissertation used a range of methodological approaches to better understand the neural underpinnings of mood and anxiety disorders.']",01/01/2017,Psychology,Dissertation,None,no embargo,Young_northwestern_0163D_13916.pdf

Detection of early-stage cancer has been widely recognized as one of the most critical factors to successfully treat cancer and reduce mortality [1]. Current gold standards for cancer diagnosis includes computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, conventional X-ray imaging, and positron emission tomography followed by tissue biopsy or fine-needle aspiration to confirm [2, 3]. However, these techniques are ineffective in sensing early-stage cancer development since very early cancerous alterations happens at macromolecule scales within pre-cancer cells that cannot be detected by the aforementioned techniques. While optical microscopy is an ideal tool to access the information within cellular structures, the diffraction limit prevents resolving length scales under ~200nm.', 'Facilitated by three-dimensional, full-vector finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) computational solutions of Maxwell’s equations, our group has developed a novel optical microscopy technique, Partial Wave Spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy, that can detect nanoarchitectural alterations within biological cells.  These alterations are not visible using conventional optical microscopy techniques [4]. With a scale sensitivity as fine as ~20 nm, PWS enables probing nanoscale density variations in macromolecular complexes, such as chromatin remodeling [5]. PWS appears capable of detecting nanoscale changes occurring during the entire carcinogenesis process, thereby permitting early-stage cancer screening.', 'Despite the success of PWS, it made simple assumptions about the model of cells and instrument. For example, it assumes the cell has flat surfaces and the microscope has an illumination NA of 0. Additionally, the effect of biological staining on spectra is not clear. In this dissertation, we expand the theory to include more realistic models of cells and instrument and validate rigorously via FDTD simulations. The results from these theoretical developments will provide essential information to optimize PWS for better diagnosis.', 'In this dissertation, we first develop essential modules in our FDTD software package to allow simulations of rough surface, staining, and finite NA (Chapter 2). Facilitated by FDTD simulations, we develop new protocols and biomarkers to enhance the diagnostic power of PWS (Chapter 3).

By exploring these local artistic approaches, this research reveals the salience of hip-hop performance in cultivating social movements, embodied politics, and choreographic repertoires that respond to youth-of-color criminalization and police brutality. Chicago’s racial and economic segregation, history of police misconduct, and concentrated poverty continues to render the mobility of, namely, Black people precarious. Each chapter reads these forms of curtailed and regulated movement against hip-hop’s kinesthetic practices—whether animated through slam poets’ physicality, the sonic imaginaries of freestyling, or through rap’s activist ethos. In doing so, it asks: How does hip-hop’s liberating employment of the body—its insurgent kinesis—operate within and around regimes of power that seek to contain, curtail, and foreclose personal freedom? ', '\tI explore this question in my ethnographic research in two specific sites: (1) Kuumba Lynx (KL), a hip-hop community arts organization in Chicago’s Uptown neighborhood where I’ve spent five years collaborating with instructors and students to better understand their artistic praxis, and (2) Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC), a five-story detention center for incarcerated adolescents, where I have taught digital music production since 2014. My participant observation and interview data, combined with a detailed analysis of a local gangster rap subgenre called “drill music,” spotlight how my interlocutors use performance to carve out spaces of liberation from within constricting environments—that is, how they get free.', '\tChapter one details how KL uses stylized movement, grassroots theater, and political education to interpret and critique the inequalities their students face. Through partnerships with local activist groups, students learn to safely comport themselves during police searches, often using artistic exercises to “rehearse” these interactions. Chapter two spotlights how JTDC residents,’ in lieu of material freedom, use rap music to traverse the center’s immobilizing setting and extend their voices beyond its walls. Finally, chapter three analyzes how drill rappers residing in the South Side’s restricting geography use social media to reach audiences outside of their neighborhoods. Their complex gang-oriented performances in music videos comprise movement vocabularies that communicate kinship, belonging, and mourning, while also propagating “Chiraq,” a moniker for Chicago that equates the city to a militarized zone of violence.

In the present study, we evaluated the association between the interaction of patterns of depression with patterns of smoking and three CVH outcomes: a clinical assessment, biomarkers of physiological processes associated with CVH, and additional behaviors associated with CVH. It was hypothesized that individuals with higher or increasing exposure to depression as well as higher or increasing exposure to smoking throughout young adulthood would have significantly worsening CVH throughout middle adulthood compared to individuals with depression exposure only, smoking exposure only, or neither. ', '\tMethods: Data for this study were from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Using PROC TRAJ in SAS, we modeled trajectories of depression (assessed on the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale: CES-D) from Year 5 to Year 15 and smoking (cigarettes per day: CPD) from Year 0 to Year 15. Three interactions were evaluated, including depression status trajectory x smoking status trajectory, CES-D score trajectory x CPD trajectory, and CES-D score trajectory x CPD trajectory among smokers. CVH was assessed by: 1) American Heart Association (AHA) CVH Score from Year 15 to Year 25, 2) biomarkers of inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein: hsCRP), oxidative stress (F2-isoprostanes and superoxide dismutase: SOD), and endothelial dysfunction (sP-selectin and sICAM1) at Year 15, and 3) behaviors, including physical activity and alcohol use from Year 15 to Year 25 and sleep patterns from Year 15 to Year 20. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the associations between depressive symptoms trajectories, smoking trajectories, and both with change in CVH outcomes. Linear regression models were used for biomarkers, which were only measured at Year 15, and sleep outcomes, which only produced a single change score from Year 15 to Year 20.', '\tResults: The depression trajectory x smoking trajectory interaction was not associated with change in AHA CVH Score in the full sample or among smokers (all p-values > .05). The depression trajectory x smoking trajectory interaction was associated with hsCRP in the full sample (pinteraction<.001) and SOD among smokers (pinteraction=.003), but no associations were observed with sP-selectin, F2-isoprostanes, or sICAM1 (all p-values > .01). The depression trajectory x smoking trajectory interaction was associated with changes in alcohol use in the full sample (pinteraction=.008) and changes in sleep duration in the full sample (pinteraction<.001); no associations were observed with physical activity or sleep disturbance, and none of the models among smokers were significant (all p-values > .0125). ', '\tDiscussion: Overall, results did not support an association between depression, smoking, and CVH outcomes. Nonetheless, this was the first study to evaluate the potential modifying effect of smoking on the association between depressive symptom patterns and CVH outcomes. Future directions include further validation of CVH measures and assessments, understanding the mechanisms by which depressive symptoms and comorbid conditions negatively affect CVH, and developing interventions to address depressive symptoms for CVH promotion.']",1/1/2017,Clinical Psychology,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_526697\Carroll_northwestern_0163D_13818.pdf,,,,,,,

These factors can be manipulated to target specific biomedical applications, such as drug delivery and sensing, through functionalized surfaces. The development of specialized synthetic methods for the precise control of nanoparticle size and morphology enables the desired ligand distribution. Nanoparticle curvature has a significant effect on ligand loading; understanding this relationship is critical in determining particle-cell interactions. This work focused on the factors affecting the synthesis mechanism and post-synthetic separation of anisotropic gold nanostars (AuNS) and the quantification of ligand distribution on varying nanoparticle morphologies.', 'The seedless synthesis of AuNS requires two precursors, but the methodology often resulted in poor yield of branched particles. In Chapter 2, we described four critical factors affecting the final nanoparticle morphology: mechanical agitation, concentration ratio, buffer type, and chemical environment. We established a set of design considerations to increase the homogeneity of nanoparticle shape and anisotropic particle yield and expanded the library of precursors used for anisotropic growth to include a morpholine-based buffer. This work led to the creation and classification of a collection of nanoparticles with tunable optical properties. ', 'While synthesizing AuNS with a morpholine-based buffer was possible, the buffer created unstable and heterogenous particles. In Chapter 3, we showed a robust strategy to obtain highly homogenous AuNS populations through a stabilization and sorting method. By altering the storage conditions, particle stability increased three-fold. The stable AuNS were separated through density gradient centrifugation (DGC) based on branch length and number. We demonstrated that one round of DGC efficiently separated AuNS populations and additional rounds did not improve homogeneity.', 'In Chapter 4, we used our optimized separation methodology to obtain DNA-functionalized particles. Specifically, we probed how curvature of individual particles impacted ligand distribution through time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. AuNS with a medium density of branches had six-fold more ligands per particle than a spherical nanoparticle of comparable size. As branch number increased beyond this point, the negative curvature increased and hindered additional ligand loading. This fundamental tool allowed for the simultaneously probing of an inorganic core and unlabeled-ligands on the single particle level.', 'Finally, in chapter 5, we explored the mechanism of the seedless growth of anisotropic AuNS through evaluating the intermediate species of the reaction. By repurposing electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we studied the radical concentration in situ during the reaction and determined the effect of buffer concentration and type.

Unique from other trucking assignment models that examine assigning trucks for a large fleet of vehicles under a company's control, this model considers the case of many independent but homogeneous carriers that are competing for loads by bidding in auctions administered by an online freight exchange. The competitors follow optimal bidding hyperpaths to maximize their expected profit. The carriers all utilize an Online freight exchange (OFEX) platform that allows shippers to advertise loads to a large number of freight operators in search of loads.  Such platforms often serve the purpose of matching demand and supply for freight in real-time.  "", ""The dissertation starts by developing a hyperpath truck routing problem that leverages the power of an OFEX platform. The OFEX routing problem seeks to determine a hyperpath in a space-time expanded network that maximizes the expected profit for a given origin-destination pair and tour duration. At the core of the OFEX routing problem is a combined pricing and bidding model that simultaneously (1) considers the probability of winning a load at a given bid price and current market competition; (2) anticipates the future profit corresponding to the present decision; and (3) prioritizes the bidding order among possible load options.  Results from numerical experiments, constructed using real-world data from a Chinese OFEX platform, indicate that the proposed routing model could (1) improve trucks' expected profits up to 400%, compared to the myopic and recursive benchmark solutions built to represent the state of the practice; and (2) enhance the robustness of the overall profitability against the impact of market competition and spatial variations."", 'The interference of the hyperpath routing model is that as more trucks utilize the method, the less advantageous the hyperpaths become due to the increased competition. Therefore, the dissertation continues to explain an equilibrium model that leverages the hyperpath truck routing solution to enable a solution for all trucks. This dissertation proposes a new hyperpath-based dynamic trucking equilibrium (DTE) assignment model.  Unlike existing freight assignment models, this model focuses on the interactions between individual truck operators that solely compete for loads advertised on an online freight exchange. The competing trucks are assumed to follow optimal bidding and routing strategies - represented using a hyperpath - to maximize their expected profit. The proposed DTE model helps (1) predict system-wide truck flows (including empty truck flows), (2) identify efficiency improvements gained by network-wide visibility, and (3) lay the foundation for building a system optimal model. We rewrite the DTE conditions as a variational inequality problem (VIP) and discuss the analytical properties of the formulation, including solution existence. A heuristic solution algorithm is developed to solve the VIP, which consists of three modules: a dynamic network loading procedure for mapping hyperpath flows onto the freight network, a column generation scheme for creating hyperpaths as needed, and a  method of successive average for equilibrating profits on existing hyperpaths.  The model and the solution algorithm are validated by numerical experiments constructed from empirical data collected in China.   The results show that the DTE solutions outperform with wide margin the benchmark solutions that either ignore inter-truck interaction or operate trucks according to suboptimal routing and bidding decisions.']",1/1/2018,Civil and Environmental Engineering,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_559457\Miller_northwestern_0163D_14024.pdf,,,,,,,

Hispanic youth have particularly pressing mental health needs in detention and as they age.  Studies examining psychiatric disorders among Hispanic youth in detention do not differentiate by ethnicity; rather they consider Hispanics as a homogenous group.  To our knowledge, no prospective longitudinal study has examined ethnic differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among Hispanic youth in detention and as they age into adulthood.  The current study addresses these omissions in the literature.  Using a sample of Mexican and Puerto Rican juvenile detainees from Cook County, Chicago, the current study examines ethnic differences in: 1) the prevalence of psychiatric disorders at detention; 2) the prevalence of psychiatric disorders during the 16 years after detention; and 3) the persistence of psychiatric disorders during the 16 years after detention.

4,\etdadmin_upload_565341,Gender Differences in Youth Externalizing Comorbidity,"(None, 'Kathrin', None, 'Herzhoff')",Clinical psychology,In Copyright,"['This dissertation examined gender differences in youth externalizing comorbidity via three studies. Study 1 was a meta-analytic review that provided the first robust estimate of gender differences in youth externalizing comorbidity. Studies 2 and 3 unpacked these gender differences at two levels of analysis: personality (Study 2 and 3) and hormones (Study 3). Hypotheses for gender differences were guided by predominant theories, such as the gender paradox, gender intensification, and sexual selection theory. Both, these predominant theories and the limited prior studies on gender differences, generally suggested higher rates of comorbidity in externalizing girls than boys. Study 1 was a meta-analytic review of gender differences in youth externalizing comorbidity that was able to test these hypotheses and provided the first unbiased descriptive information regarding gender differences. This meta-analysis of epidemiological studies that conceptualized psychopathology categorically showed no evidence of gender differences in odds for experiencing comorbidity between oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder (CD) and internalizing disorders. Having an externalizing disorder also increased the odds of having another disorder similarly across the genders. In addition, being a girl was associated with lower odds of experiencing comorbidity within externalizing disorders (e.g., attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-ODD, ADHD-CD, ODD-CD) and lower odds of experiencing comorbidity between ADHD and internalizing disorders such as depressive and anxiety disorders. Age consistently accounted for externalizing-anxiety comorbidity rates in girls only, such that these comorbidity rates increased with age for girls. Thus, fewer gender differences were found in the meta-analysis than would be predicted by predominant theories. In fact, when gender differences were found, they were often in the direction opposite to the prediction, e.g., being a girl was associated with lower odds of comorbidity between ADHD and anxiety disorders. Study 2 tested whether child personality accounted for ODD comorbidity patterns more strongly in girls than boys in line with prior findings that girls need more risk factors than boys for the expression of other externalizing disorders. Participants in Study 2 were 346 children (49% boys; Mage = 9.97 years, SDage = 0.83 years) and their parents. Both parents reported on their child’s psychopathology symptoms and temperament/personality traits via questionnaires. One parent and the child also reported on the child’s psychopathology via structured clinical interview. Thus, I was able to conceptualize psychopathology dimensionally using symptom-counts. ODD comorbidity with externalizing disorders (i.e., CD and ADHD) was generally accounted for by variance in agreeableness and conscientiousness, whereas internalizing disorder comorbidity (i.e., depression and anxiety) was accounted for by variance in neuroticism. Gender moderation was largely absent. The overall lack of gender-specific results suggested that personality traits seem to be equally relevant for explaining boys’ and girls’ manifest ODD behaviors. Finally, Study 3 extended the nomological network of a bifactor model of psychopathology, a modern conceptualization of psychopathology and comorbidity, and neuroticism, by examining gender differences and associations with cortisol reactivity. For Study 3, mothers and their 349 primarily 9-to-10-year-old children (53% girls) were interviewed about the child’s psychopathology and mothers completed questionnaires about the child’s psychopathology and dispositional traits. Cortisol reactivity was measured while children performed a standardized laboratory stress task. This study found (1) partial support for gender invariance of the bifactor models of psychopathology and neuroticism, (2) mean level differences only on a specific fear factor (higher scores for girls), (3) gender moderation only of the specific irritability—externalizing association (stronger in boys), and (4) a significant association between the specific externalizing factor and low cortisol reactivity. As such, Study 3 also showed limited evidence for consistent gender differences in a bifactor model of psychopathology and the factors’ associations with neuroticism and cortisol reactivity. Across studies, theoretical and clinical implications were discussed, especially regarding the lack of support for existing gender theories, publication bias as a possibility for prior study’s significant findings regarding gender differences, and the importance of personality in assessment of psychopathology for both boys and girls.']",1/1/2018,Psychology,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_565341\Herzhoff_northwestern_0163D_14067.pdf,,,,,,,

These factors have led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) to identify P. aeruginosa as a severe threat to public health.  Thus, understanding P. aeruginosa pathogenesis is of interest and concern to the medical and scientific communities.  In the current study, we examined factors that contribute to pathogenesis, including the host immune response and antimicrobial resistance.  Using mice deficient in components of the inflammasome, an important component of the host innate immune defense to infection, we demonstrated that the inflammasome adaptor protein apoptosis speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) is associated with severe pre-lethal illness in a mouse model of pneumonia.  In the absence of ASC, infected mice exhibited improved survival and bacterial clearance from the lungs compared to mice lacking the inflammasome effector protein caspase-1/11 and C57BL/6 (B6) mice.  Interestingly, we found that ASC is required for activation of caspase-3 in addition to caspase-1.  Furthermore, activation of ASC-dependent caspase-3 activity was dependent on P. aeruginosa possessing a functional type III secretion system.  Collectively, these findings may provide an alternate strategy for P. aeruginosa to promote severe infection in vivo by activating caspase-3 through ASC, independent of caspase-1 activation.  Next, we utilized a pre-existing library of P. aeruginosa isolates to analyze relationships between antimicrobial resistance and bacterial virulence using statistical models.  We found that strains with higher bacterial virulence had a lower odds ratio of exhibiting an antibiotic-resistant or MDR phenotype by logistic regression.  Interestingly, P. aeruginosa strains that secrete the T3SS effector protein ExoU had higher odds ratio of antibiotic resistance.  We also found a correlation between resistance to a greater number of antimicrobial classes and lower virulence scores by linear regression.  Collectively, these models demonstrate an inverse relationship between antimicrobial resistance and bacterial virulence.  In summary, we describe how P. aeruginosa exacerbates the ASC-mediated immune response to promote severe illness in a mouse model of pneumonia and how strains of increased virulence are more likely to be antibiotic susceptible or exhibit resistance to fewer antimicrobial classes.  These results further our understanding of the various strategies that P. aeruginosa employs to overcome clearance mechanisms in promoting disease.']",1/1/2018,Driskill Graduate Training Program in Life Sciences,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2019",Private,\etdadmin_upload_567449\Hughes_northwestern_0163D_14070.pdf,,,,,,,
6,\etdadmin_upload_578673,Essays in Banking,"(None, 'Alice', 'Yehjin', 'Jun')",Finance,In Copyright,"[""This dissertation seeks to contribute to our knowledge of banks and how they operate. I explore three broad questions: 1) why certain types of banks are important, 2) how banks use internal capital markets, and 3) what affects banks' decisions to pursue external financing."", ""In Chapter 1, I address the larger question of why small banks are important by exploring if loans from small banks are easily substitutable. I focus on the small business loan market, and I use a bank's exposure to a natural disaster in one county as an instrument for its credit supply to other counties that are unaffected by natural disasters. Through internal capital markets, and due to external financing frictions, a positive credit demand shock in the disaster county becomes a negative credit supply shock to non-disaster counties. Importantly, only small banks shift lending in this manner, allowing me to isolate the effect of a shock from small, and not large, banks. In the non-disaster counties, I find that, first, small banks step in for other small banks, while large banks step in only under conditions that suggest there is less adverse selection in the market. This is consistent with a story in which small banks are important because of their ability to collect soft information (information that is not easily quantifiable) about borrowers. This allows them to serve a segment of the market that large banks are less well-suited to serve, because large banks focus on collecting hard information (information that is easily quantifiable). Second, I find that the credit supply shock has real effects on the number of small businesses; moreover, firms that depend on a local customer base are more adversely affected. This is consistent with a story in which small banks collect soft information about local markets, which allows them to better serve these firms. Overall, the results suggest that small banks play a unique role in a segmented borrower market."", ""In Chapter 2, I look at how banks use internal capital markets by focusing on how they shift different types of mortgages across their lending network in response to a disaster. Applying the same identification strategy in Chapter 1 to mortgage markets, I find that most movements of capital are consistent with a story in which banks use internal capital markets to manage liquidity; for example, banks increase total lending to disaster counties while reducing total lending to non-disaster counties, and in particular, banks reduce supply of loans that they keep, but not loans that they sell. However, the most interesting result is that banks $increase$ supply of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to non-disaster counties, while increasing supply of conventional loans to disaster counties. Because borrowers who obtain FHA loans usually have higher credit risk, this could imply a risk management story: given an influx of safer conventional loans in the non-disaster counties, perhaps banks' appetite for riskier FHA loans in non-disaster counties increases. However, anecdotal evidence suggests some banks believe they are overly compensated for originating FHA loans, relative to the risk they take on by doing so. Thus, these results could also be consistent with a story in which bank (possibly overly) originate FHA loans, because they view these loans are a source of low-risk liquidity."", 'In Chapter 3, I address why banks might have been reluctant to raise external financing during the crisis by exploring the role of strategic complementarities between existing stakeholders and potential investors. I model existing short-term debtholders and a pool of potential equityholders, and I start the game after the bank is already known to be insolvent to strip out the well-documented information channel, through which a bank might be reluctant to issue equity because doing so could signal that the bank is distressed. I find that there is a subset of banks that fail, even though they would have survived if they received full financing. For these banks, debtholders refuse to rollover because they (correctly) anticipate that the equity issuance will fail, and and equityholders refuse to invest because they anticipate that the bank will suffer a rollover freeze. These strategic complementarities clearly lead to an efficiency loss, but can also be part of the solution: a central bank need only invest enough bailout funds to allay current and potential stakeholders.']",1/1/2018,Finance,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_578673\Jun_northwestern_0163D_14089.pdf,,,,,,,

Thus, it is important to understand how the purchasing experiences and the factors surrounding the multichannel shopping environment shape their future customers’ behaviors. In my essays, I demonstrate the use of novel quasi-experimental designs in investigating how social influence and product unavailability affect customer behavior. ', 'In the first chapter, “Small Networks: Intra-household Interactions in a Multichannel Environment,” I study familial interactions and the mutual influences household members have in the shopping process. A multi-person household is a small network, which raises the possibility that household members’ actions are interrelated. Although many firms recognize that individuals within a household may have distinct preferences, the possibility that purchase behaviors may be related in a multichannel environment has received far less attention. I investigate these issues in the context of a major U.S. apparel retailer. In a descriptive analysis, I first show household members’ purchases are highly correlated; when a spouse purchases, the partner tends to purchase. I then show that whether household members coordinate their purchases is predictive of the future value of their spending. ', 'Furthermore, I develop an instrumental variables approach to tackle the problem of whether a causal relationship exists. I find that a 10% increase in spending by a female partner influences the male to increase spending by 1.9%. A similar increase in spending by males leads females to increase spending by 3%. In addition to this asymmetric effect among genders, I find evidence of channel asymmetry. In particular, the intra-household effect is strongest in the retail channel, followed by the catalog and Internet channels. I also show how customer, household, and seasonal traits moderate the intra-household effect. Most notably, the baseline spending level of the customer who is being influenced by the partner’s purchase positively moderates the intra-household effect. Lastly, through simulations I find that without the existence of intra-household effects, the customers’ total spending would have been significantly lower. The ROI of targeting would also be underestimated if such effects are not properly taken into account. Overall, this research emphasizes the importance of marketing to a household not as a single unit but as a small network.', 'In the second chapter, “The Long-Term Impact of Backorder Delays: A Quasi-Experimental Approach” (with Eric Anderson), we document how product unavailability, in the context of backorders, influences customers’ future shopping behavior. When an item goes temporarily out of stock, it is common practice for firms to inform consumers that the item will be shipped but delayed, which is referred to as a backorder. Measuring the effect of backorders is challenging due to endogeneity: the best customers are most likely to experience backorders. We develop a quasi-experimental approach that allows us to measure the near-term and long-term impact of backorders on customer purchase behavior. We use extremely detailed transaction data to create narrow event windows before and after a backorder occurs. After conditioning on these windows and controls, the backorders are plausibly random. ', 'We find that experiencing a backorder leads to the customer decreasing future orders by 2.2% in the subsequent year. The effect intensifies as the delay magnitude increases. For instance, a backorder delay that extends beyond 20 days results in the customer reducing future orders by 8.4% and an impact that endures for years. In addition, when a backorder occurs, the firm quotes a new delivery date, an estimate for when it expects the item to arrive. If customers are anchored to this new reference point, quoted delivery dates might play a role in managing their expectations. We examine whether there are any recovery or aggravating effects when the item arrives earlier or later than the quoted date and any evidence of loss aversion. Overall, we find little evidence that the firm can effectively manage customers’ expectations. Rather, some results indicate that conservatively quoted delivery dates might be negatively affecting customers. Last, we study how item popularity moderates the impact of backorder delays. We find that backorder delays that happen in the medium popularity category cause a stronger backlash in customers than those in the low or high popularity categories.']",1/1/2018,Marketing,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_585761\Bhan_northwestern_0163D_14135.pdf,,,,,,,

Perceiving a crisis of technocratic liberalism in the postwar period, Wolin develops a critique of modernity that emphasizes the loss both of political vision and of local cultures and traditions. His subsequent radical democratic theory identifies a contrapuntal American tradition of local self-governance that he continually fears is being lost. I argue that this approach to democracy offers important insights into recent crises of liberalism by attending to narratives of loss that have largely been harnessed by right-wing populism. At the same time, however, Wolin’s tendency to focus on loss means that he often downplays the persistence of white and male supremacist nationalism and the value of modern rights and institutions. The dissertation interrogates the troubling aspects of Wolin’s approach through engagements with other postwar critics of liberalism, contemporary theorists of democracy, and critical race theorists. It argues that, although Wolin’s understanding of tradition remains too monolithic, he ultimately develops a more complex, “polymorphous” understanding of democracy that combines traditional with transgressive and state-centric elements. The dissertation concludes by examining Wolin’s efforts to reconcile his understanding of political theory with his broader notion of political education.']",1/1/2018,Political Science,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_585781\Cane_northwestern_0163D_14136.pdf,,,,,,,

With the recent advancement in a neural network or deep learning research, machine learning models can construct general vector representations of words, also known as word embeddings, that are useful for many natural language processing tasks. Furthermore, neural language models can accurately assign a probability to a sequence of text, and become a default choice of researchers and developers. One of the key advantages of these deep learning models is that they require little to none human heuristics in feature engineering, and instead, are optimized using a large amount of data.', 'Despite the performance improvement and convenience of the neural language models, they lack a useful property found in the previous statistical model such as an n-gram language model -- the parameters of neural language models are not directly interpretable. This leads to a set of challenges when using such models.

In this dissertation, I propose and defend an original reading of Kant’s late treatise ""Der Streit der Fakultäten"" (The Conflict of the Faculties) which aims to show that he should in fact count among the radical libertarians of the Enlightenment era whose conception of libertarianism have clear socialist implications. I then propose to use the form of ""The Conflict of the Faculties"" as I reconstruct it to interrogate the ethical-political thought of three very different post-Kantians, namely, G. W. F. Hegel, Hannah Arendt, and Jürgen Habermas.', 'Chapter 1 lays out the object, scope, method, and normative standpoint of the study. Here I propose that we read Kant’s ""The Conflict of the Faculties"" as a systematically connected exposition of what I call his metapolitics. This is a term that I introduce to characterize the difference between a major treatise on politics such as Kant’s ""Rechtslehre"" (Doctrine of Right) and a minor one such as ""The Conflict of the Faculties."" I define a metapolitical doctrine as that part of a philosophical system which treats of questions left unaddressed by the major political treatise. There are three such questions: (i) What are the rights and obligations of philosophy in the political public sphere (what I call the intellectual-political conflict of the faculties)? (ii) What are the methodological rights of philosophy to intervene in domains of knowledge considered to be the exclusive property of neighboring humanistic disciplines that happen to also play an ideological function in the service of the state (what I call the methodological-political conflict of the faculties)? And (iii) What are the ultimate moral ends of political life and why (what I call the ethical-political conflict of the faculties)? Taken together, answers to these three questions constitute what I call a philosopher’s metapolitics or metapolitical doctrine. I contend here that in addition to being a fruitful way to inquire into the politics of the thinkers under study in this dissertation, this may also be a productive avenue of systematic inquiry into the politics of other philosophers, belonging to different historical epochs and traditions. Chapter 1 concludes with a normative defense of libertarian socialism as the most appropriate metapolitical doctrine.  ', 'In Chapter 2 the dissertation reconstructs Kant’s metapolitics by way of recovering his answers to the three conflicts of the faculties and then goes on to assess it. I argue here that Kant’s metapolitics consists of three pillars: (i) institutionalized rational dissent (his answer to the intellectual-political conflict), (ii) a principled defense of the rights of practical philosophy (his answer to the methodological-political conflict), and (iii) libertarian republicanism (his answer to the ethical-political conflict). Chapters 3, 4, and 5 of the dissertation reconstruct the answers to the same set of three questions of Hegel, Arendt and Habermas, respectively. I find that Hegel’s answer to the three conflicts of the faculties are (i) Staatsphilosophie (state philosophy) (his answer to the first conflict), (ii) a defense of the rights of speculative philosophy (his answer to the second conflict), and (iii) technocratic corporatism (his answer to the third conflict). Arendt’s metapolitical triad in turn consists of (i) men of letters’ anticonformism (her answer to the first conflict); (ii) a defense of the rights of political theory (her answer the second conflict); and (iii) the aristocratic council system (her answer to the third conflict). Finally, Habermas’s metapolitical triad is based on the following three pillars: (i) universal public intellectualism (his answer to the first conflict); (ii) critical social science and postmetaphyiscal philosophy (his answers to the second conflict); and (iii) deliberative democracy (his answer to the third conflict). In each case, after the exposition of the answers, I provide a critical assessment of each of the metapolitical doctrines that they constitute. I find that Kant’s metapolitical doctrine is the closest to the libertarian-socialist metapolitics I defend in Chapter 1, whereas Hegel’s is directly opposed to it. ', 'The metapolitics of Arendt and Habermas are more complicated. I find that early Habermas was the closest to the spirit of Enlightenment humanism and libertarian socialism in all the important domains: political economy, philosophical anthropology, and cultural politics. However, after the shift to the communicative paradigm which begins around the time of his Christian Gauss lecture (1970/71), Habermas’s commitment to libertarian socialist or Enlightenment humanist positions continues to remain strong only in German cultural politics, whereas it is significantly weakened if not altogether abandoned in the domains of political economy and philosophical anthropology. A rather similar development holds true of Arendt. Up until her Christian Gauss lecture at Princeton (1953), she is so close to Enlightenment libertarian and socialist ideals that she is able to correctly point out the “not entirely visible but very powerful” connection between Kant and Marx. After this point in time, however, many of her radical positions in political economy and philosophical anthropology are either significantly weakened or completely given up.', 'The dissertation concludes with the defense of a libertarian-socialist viewpoint on the three conflicts of the faculties. Such a viewpoint turns on three key ideas: (i) speaking truth to the people (the answer to the intellectual-political conflict), (ii) a conception of critical social science that embraces Hume’s mitigated skepticism and Kant’s sovereignty of practical reason (the answer to the methodological-political conflict), and (iii) a political ethics based on a philosophical anthropology that Kant, the German romantics, and the young Marx have in common (the answer to the ethical-political conflict).']",1/1/2018,Political Science,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_586132\Carrabregu_northwestern_0163D_14144.pdf,,,,,,,

Polymer conjugated coiled-coil peptides are a new addition to these designer macromolecules. Even though a variety of experiments and computational simulations have shown stabilization of helices upon polymer conjugation, there are still many questions regarding the conformations of the attached polymer chains and their effects on the thermomechanical and aggregation behavior of peptides. Here, we first investigate the self-assembly of coiled-coils with single polymer chains covalently conjugated to either the end or side, and compare with no polymer conjugation. Our results ascertain polymer stabilization effects on both structural and thermodynamical properties of the peptides. Next, based on scaling theory for tethered polymers, we study multiple polymer chain conjugation to investigate the effect of conjugation density on the stability of coiled-coils and to explore the mushroom conformation of polymer chains on the helix surface. Our findings reveal the molecular mechanisms underpinning recent experimental observations on the stability of protein–PEG conjugates and lay the groundwork for development of stable protein bundles that can serve as drug delivery vehicles, nanocarriers and other biomechanical building blocks. ', 'Building on these findings, we focus on a recent design that has utilized end-conjugation of alkyl chains to 3-helix coiled-coils to achieve amphiphilicity, combined with the side-chain conjugation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to tune micelle size through entropic confinement forces. Next, we investigate this phenomenon in depth, using micelle theory and coarse-grained dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations in an explicit solvent. We analyze the conformations of the PEG chains conjugated to three different positions on 3-helix bundle peptides to observe the degree of confinement upon assembly, as well as the ordering of the subunits making up the micelle. We discover that the micelle size and stability is dictated by competition between the entropy of the PEG chain conformations in the assembled state and intermolecular cross-interactions among PEG chains that promote cohesion between neighboring conjugates. Our analyses build on the role of PEG molecular weight and conjugation site in micelle shape and lead to computational phase diagrams that can be used to design 3-helix micelles. This work opens pathways for the design of multifunctional micelles with tunable size, shape and stability.', 'Homomeric micelles with tunable size, shape and stability have been extensively studied for biomedical applications such as drug carriers. However, designing the local valency and self-assembled morphology of nanophase-separated multicomponent micelles with varied ligand binding sites remains challenging. Finally, we present micelles self-assembled from amphiphilic peptide-PEG-lipid hybrid conjugates, where the peptides can be either 3-helix or 4-helix coiled-coils. We demonstrate that the micelle size and sphericity can be controlled based on the coiled-coil oligomeric state. Using theory and coarse-grained dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations in an explicit solvent simulation, we studied the distribution of 3-helix and 4-helix conjugates within the mixed micelles and observed self-organization into nanodomains within the mixed micelle. We discover that the phase separation behavior is dictated by the geometry mismatch in alkyl chain length from different coiled-coil oligomeric states. Our analyses on the self-assembly tendency and drug delivery potency of mixed micelles with controlled multivalency provide further important insights into the assembly and formation of nanophase-separated micelles.']",1/1/2018,Mechanical Engineering,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_586208\Ma_northwestern_0163D_14145.pdf,,,,,,,

Even though it seems there is some market discipline in the hospital industry, we observe that many patients go to hospitals far from the quality frontier and we still do not have a full understanding of why that is the case. The chapters of this thesis study different forces that play a role in the allocative process in this industry.', 'Chapters 1 and 2 study persistence in hospital choices of patients in the State of New York. Specifically, I analyze the causal impact of the previous hospital choice of a patient on her current choice. Although the conventional wisdom is that patients are loyal to hospitals, there is actually little hard evidence supporting this idea. While inertia in consumer choice has been documented in many settings, there are very few studies on inertia in choice of medical provider. The first two chapters of this dissertation try to fill this gap by exploring the extent and determinants of patient loyalty toward hospitals.', 'Chapter 1 studies persistence in hospital choices of patients across different medical conditions. To disentangle state dependence from persistent unobserved heterogeneity, I exploit choice set variation across episodes due to emergency hospitalizations and temporary hospital closures due to Hurricane Sandy. I find that patients who are forced to switch hospitals by an exogenous shock are more likely to continue using the new hospital in the future than similar patients. After showing that there is state dependence in my setting, I study whether it stands in the way of the reallocation of patients to high quality providers in the context of hospital choice for heart surgery.', 'Chapter 2 is a complement to Chapter 1. It analyzes persistence in hospital choices of patients for childbirth. For identification, I follow a more traditional strategy than in Chapter 1 that relies on the existence of consumers who are new to the market (first-time mothers) and experienced consumers (mothers who had births before). I show that on average a mother is more likely to choose the same hospital used in the previous birth for her current birth than an observationally similar first-time mother. The results are in line with the findings of Chapter 1, suggesting that patient loyalty is a general phenomenon.', 'Finally, Chapter 3 analyzes the impact of provider financial incentives on hospital behavior. It focuses on a major regulatory reform to the Long-Term Care Hospital industry that substantially reduced payments for about half the Medicare patient population treated in this setting. I study the strategies that Long-Term Care Hospitals have implemented to mitigate the impact of the new regulatory framework and the effects of these actions on access to care and treatment intensity. I find evidence that hospitals screen patients who are referred for long-term acute care more actively than before the reform and are more likely to reject those patients for which reimbursement decreased. In addition, many hospitals altered their discharge patterns in a way that is hard to explain given the way that financial incentives changed with the reform.']",1/1/2018,Economics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_586247\Irace_northwestern_0163D_14146.pdf,,,,,,,

Scientists can “knock down” or deplete a specific RNA by introducing small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes that are fully complementarity to a region within the intended target. However, targeting can occur with complementarity of as little as six bps between an siRNA’s so-called seed sequence and a mRNA’s 3’ Untranslated Region (UTR). This seed-based targeting produces off-target effects (OTEs) in RNAi experiments, which result from unintended target RNAs, which harbor complementarity to the siRNA’s seed sequence, being downregulated. Whereas scientists can accurately predict the cellular effects of a specific and potent siRNA, provided the function of its intended target is understood, the phenotypic changes associated with seed-based OTEs (sOTEs) cannot be as easily predicted because these changes depend on the net outcome of a promiscuous six nt seed sequence that simultaneously, and to varying degrees of efficiency, targets up to hundreds of genes harboring, by chance, a compatible target site.', 'Non-overlapping siRNAs that specifically and potently target the same gene would be predicted to evoke the same phenotypic change, provided the intended target performs an overt function. However, non-overlapping siRNAs with different seed sequences, even those designed to target a common gene, would also be predicted to evoke different sOTEs because of differences in off-target profiles. However, this presented work shows this is not always the case.', 'Indeed, over 80% of commercially available siRNAs and short hairpin (sh)RNAs derived from CD95/CD95L mRNA sequences are toxic to cancer cells in the absence of the intended target site in these two genes, demonstrating this toxicity is independent of knocking down CD95 or CD95L and likely results from repression of other genes through seed-based targeting. This was confirmed by assessing the toxicity and functionality of chemically-modified and chimeric siRNAs. An shRNA lethality screen composed of every shRNA that can be derived from these two genes and an unrelated control gene, Venus, showed toxic sequences are enriched in certain regions including the Open Reading Frame (ORF) and the 3’ UTR of CD95L and CD95, respectively.', 'These nonredundant CD95/CD95L-derived si/shRNAs all induce a novel form of cancer', 'cell death, with distinct biochemical and morphological features best described as simultaneous activation of multiple death pathways. Interestingly, these toxic si/shRNAs, which do not share sequence homology in their seed regions, all preferentially downregulate mRNAs from the same cohort of survival genes, which initiates a unique sOTE coined Death Induced by Survival Gene Elimination (DISE). Toxicity positively correlates with the GC content of an siRNA’s seed sequence, and Dicer and Drosha knock-out cells display hypersensitivity. Together, these results reveal a subset of non-overlapping seed sequences embedded in the mRNAs of CD95 and CD95L that share certain characteristics and are highly toxic to cancer cells through the same sOTE mechanism of DISE.', 'The abundance of toxic shRNA sequences derived from the CD95L ORF, as identified in the screen, suggested the full-length mRNA may exhibit functionality independent of its role in translating for CD95L protein. Indeed, expression of wild type (WT) CD95L and CD95L mutants that do not produce full-length apoptosis-inducing proteins are toxic to cells, even those harboring homozygous deletion of the CD95 gene. Global downregulation of survival genes occurs during overexpression—similar to DISE. Small RNA fragments derived from CD95L ORF mRNA associated with the RISC in cells overexpressing CD95L cDNA were also detected. These results show that expression of certain mRNAs, in this case CD95L, may produce small guide RNAs that evoke a specific cellular response through RNAi.

It adopts the perspective that technology is fundamental to organizing in modern workplaces and examines how technology may both enhance and constrain teamwork. By adopting this perspective, two questions naturally follow. First, how do teams organize using technologies? Second, how can technologies enable teams to organize effectively? ', 'Addressing these two questions are of utmost importance due to two recent trends in contemporary organizations. The first trend is the rise of teams in the workplace, whereby firms are reorganizing as team-based structures to promote agility and fluidity. A 2018 Deloitte report that surveyed over 11,000 businesses found that an astounding ninety-one percent of executives ranked redesigning their organizations as a “network of teams” their number one priority (Deloitte Insights, 2018). The second trend is the rise in social media use for internal communications within the workplace. Unlike external uses of social media that cross many public platforms (e.g., Facebook for social networking, Twitter for microblogging), most organizations implement an integrated social media platform for internal communications that contains several functions (Leonardi, Huysman, & Steinfield, 2013). These platforms are collectively referred to as enterprise social media or ESM and recent reports show that two-thirds of organizations are already using ESM for their internal communications and this percentage continues to grow (Bughin, 2015). Yet despite the growing adoption of ESM, organizational scholars have been slow to study their impact on organizing and teamwork. Hence, many of the opportunities that social media offers workers remains at the potential level rather than evidence based. ', '\tThese two trends not only reveal that organizations are replacing traditional hierarchical structures with flatter, team-based designs but also suggest that traditional approaches to studying work teams and technology may no longer be sufficient for understanding how teams function. Accordingly, this dissertation provides a new framework for understanding contemporary teams that specifically examines how teams naturally organize with technologies and subsequently, how technologies may enable teams to organize effectively. Towards this end, it adopts a social network approach to evaluate the structural signatures or network structures that emerge from team members’ interactions.  ', '\tChapter 1 introduces the framework for investigating team properties and phenomena in this dissertation: the team form-perform paradox. This paradox refers to the disconnect between what teams do and what they ought to do to be effective. In particular, the literature on teams over the past century of research has found that teams need certain enabling conditions (Hackman, 2012) that increase the odds that they are effective. These needs include features such as diverse composition or sharing unique information. Yet the features that research has found to be most important for team performance are often disincentivized by self-formation tendencies or default team behaviors that lead to unintended consequences when people team up together. Chapter 1 proposes that the team form-perform paradox is a useful lens for synthesizing the research on teams to date and proposes that studies on teams ought to consider both the self-formation tendencies and team performance requirements in tandem, rather than as distinct entities. ', 'Building on the team form-perform paradox framework introduced in Chapter 1, Chapters 2 through 4 explore how this lens can be used to first assess, and then improve team functioning. More specifically, Chapter 2 examines how team communication networks naturally form, and then explores how formal interventions or simple team messages can improve the effectiveness of communication in the context of online team discussions. This chapter finds that formal interventions aimed at structuring group process can be a useful way to help teams overcome some of their self-formation tendencies. ', 'Chapters 3 and 4 then explore how the design features of modern technologies, namely enterprise social media, alter the self-formation tendencies of teams. Essentially, ESM offers teams unprecedented opportunities for organizing, and it is possible that these capabilities may facilitate new ways for teams to communicate, interact, and collaborate that can help teams overcome their form-perform paradox. To better understand the nature of these new opportunities, Chapter 3 develops a conceptual model for examining how social media use impacts teams. It proposes that the teaming environment shapes how social media affordances are enacted to alter how teams carry out team processes. Affordances refer to the potential for new actions that are offered by the features of an object, such as a technology, and provides a useful lens for examining both the positive and negative consequences of social media use on teams. ', 'Lastly, Chapter 4 explores some of these new opportunities empirically by examining how team communication networks form on social media and how they perform. Towards this end, Chapter 4 investigates how social media networks may complement and enhance traditional forms of informal communication within the workplace and examines the implications of these new capabilities on performance.  ', 'In short, this dissertation is about how contemporary teams use technologies to accomplish their work. The basic premise is that the rapid pace of technological improvement in the digital age offers unprecedented opportunities that potentially enable teams to overcome their self-formation tendencies to achieve their needs and accomplish their goals.']",1/1/2018,Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_586305\Ng_northwestern_0163D_14148.pdf,,,,,,,

It discusses how these texts examine, interpret, and constitute subjects that were labeled as “degenerate” by medical, juridical, and criminological discourses in late nineteenth-century Mexico. Those ostensibly “scientific” and “objective” discourses reproduced and disseminated notions of pathology, through proliferating labels of “abnormality” and a focus on diagnosis as a means to control individual bodies and the national body. This dissertation argues that ambiguous representations of gender and sexuality in Mexican modernista narratives allow their authors to appropriate, reformulate, and re-articulate a modernity imported from the metropolis. Through an analysis of modernista texts that considers the dynamic between the discourse of degeneration and the national project of modernization, this study reveals the theoretical inadequacy of positivism, which inverted the relationship between diagnostic gaze and diagnosed object, blurred and confused pathological categories, and relied on internally contradictory juridical discourse.  ', 'This dissertation consists of three case studies of articulations of degenerate bodies. The first chapter reads the chronicles, short stories, and novels of Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera, examining how the writer viewed the gender of female foreign actors as an indicator of cultural modernity. In representing female artists in these narratives, the author oscillates between emphasizing their degenerate bodies and their aesthetic superiority. The second chapter analyzes narratives by Amado Nervo, Ciro B. Ceballos, and Porfirio Parra, who represent hysterical masculine intellectual elites as modern subjects. These “abnormal” subjects, tainted by the pathology of a feminine disease, reveal the fissures inherent in a modern subject founded on the dichotomies between mind and body, spirituality and materiality, and art and science. The third chapter examines how honor, insanity, and gender combine to create a gap between the penal (in juridical discourse) and the poetic (in modernista narratives) with respect to crimes of passion. This comparative reading of juridical and literary texts reveals their narrative heterogeneity and the contradictions of the bourgeois ethics that were promoted as an important component of modernization in fin de siècle Mexico. Taken together, these three case studies shed light on the multifaceted dynamics of the representation of gender and sexuality and the construction of modernity in Mexican modernista narratives.']",1/1/2018,Spanish and Portuguese,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_586359\Oh_northwestern_0163D_14150.pdf,,,,,,,

In doing so, they challenge traditional critical approaches that oppose the novelistic genre–an art manifestation– to the mass media products–a market expression. Further, these Peruvian novels show that a critical appropriation in literature of narrative codes from mass media products like movies, radio dramas and soap operas can result in a renovation of the novel as a genre.', ""I begin with the analysis of XYZ showing how in this novel the appropriation of narrative codes from early Hollywood movies is used both to discuss the potential dangers of modernization and to configure an appealing narrative for mass consumption. I then examine how satiric parody of radio dramas (radioteatros) from the 1950s in La tía Julia y el escribidor gives shape in the text to a new figure of professional writer. This fictional model of a literary author also regards a mass media narrative code as an effective vehicle to transmit social criticism to a broader readership. I argue in Chapter 3 that an intense critic of both the literary and the broadcasting system in the trilogy of novels Morirás mañana results in a redefinition of the notion of art. As I demonstrate, this new notion incorporates both traditional art and show business values as key components. This conceptual change aims to place the novel as a genre in large consumer networks. In the final chapter, I show how Óscar y las mujeres approaches the artificiality of the Latin American soap operas (telenovelas) through ironic parody, but also how it highlights that despite this artificiality it can give meaning to modern romantic dilemmas.

Early events in follicular development are autonomous of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and are instead controlled by local factors that are used in bidirectional communication between oocytes and somatic cells. Following puberty, gonadotropins will eventually become the principle regulators of follicular growth, maturation, and ovulation. It is becoming increasingly appreciated that gonadotropin actions are achieved through interactions with local intraovarian signals. This thesis explores the functions of one such local intraovarian regulator, the Notch signaling pathway, at multiple distinct stages of ovarian follicular development.  ', '\tThe Notch pathway is a highly conserved cell-contact dependent juxtacrine signaling system and is an important regulator of primordial follicle formation in the mouse ovary. Using a reporter mouse line for identification of Notch active cells, continued Notch activity was observed in granulosa cells of follicles belonging to both the gondatropin independent and dependent stages of development.  Based on this observation, I hypothesized that the Notch signaling pathway regulates distinct follicular functions at multiple stages of development to promote the overall health of the follicle. Active Notch signaling in granulosa cells was associated with greater proliferative capacity at the prepubertal age of postnatal day (PND) 21.  The mitogenic function of Notch signaling was further confirmed using conditional knockout lines of the ligand Jag1 from germ cells (J1KO) or the receptor Notch2 from granulosa cells (N2KO) where suppressed proliferation in the ovary was observed at PND19. Significantly extending the understanding of Notch signaling during the gonadotropin-independent stage of follicular growth, a potential mechanism for Notch signaling propagation across multiple layers of granulosa cells in growing follicles was described. Activation of Notch signaling in granulosa cells led to increased expression of Jag1 ligand, which can transactivate Notch receptors on neighboring granulosa cells, consistent with a lateral induction mechanism.', '\tNotch activity and expression of Notch ligands and receptors in the ovary were shown to be positively regulated following LH-receptor activation by exogenous human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in prepubertal mice during the periovulatory period. The localization of JAG1, the most abundantly expressed Notch ligand in the mouse ovary, underwent a striking shift from oocytes to somatic cells following hormone stimulation. The function of JAG1 in ovarian steroidogenic somatic cells was investigated using a long-term primary granulosa cell culture system. Disruption of Notch signaling using siRNA knockdown of Jag1 resulted in a suppression of granulosa cell differentiation into the steroidogenic phenotype and a retention of proliferative capacity. The loss of JAG1 led to a maintenance of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway activation, which are associated with proliferation in granulosa cells.  These results indicate that the Notch signaling pathway can influence the broader signaling network in granulosa cells in complex way. During the highly dynamic periovulatory period, active Notch signaling favors the  promotion of the mature steroidogenic preovulatory phenotype, at the expense of continued proliferation. Collectively, this thesis work describes a multi-faceted role of Notch signaling as a regulator of granulosa cell proliferation and differentiation throughout the gonadotropin independent and dependent stages of follicular development.']",1/1/2018,Interdepartmental Biological Sciences (IBiS) Graduate Program,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_586399\Prasasya_northwestern_0163D_14153.pdf,,,,,,,

I utilize performance as an analytic through which to study shifting social formations and relations of power, tracing performance practices as they appear in battles over ideological, affective, and geographic territories. Based in ethnographic research between 2011 and 2017, this dissertation contends that recent upheavals in the contemporary Libyan sociopolitical landscape are illuminated by attention to sonic performances and performativities. To attend to such performances and performativities, I thematize revolutionary utopianism, militia soundscapes, and quotidian policing. I begin with the extraordinary months of the 2011 uprising when popular music became a medium through which Libyans formed and performed a new and fleeting we. Through close readings of songs and the practices through which they circulated, I theorize the utopian front(line) as an affective formation through which previously closed futurities were temporarily opened. Moving into the following years, which were characterized by instability, rapid shifts in governance, war between militias, and foreign intervention, I explore militarized sonic performance practices in Libya’s urban centers. I demonstrate how militias performed authority over shifting territories through sound, and how a range of interpellating acts produced forms of sonic governance. In a subsequent section, I show how quotidian performances of policing in Libya have utilized a repertory of Islamic reference. Tracing scenes in which music and sound occupied privileged positions in this repertory, I offer a contingent ethnographic approach to the study of music in/and Islam.

Their sustained presence on the island thereafter is attributed to both the Dutch and British colonial administrations who continued to import eastern and southern Africans via the Goa slave markets and Mozambique for military and domestic service. ‘Ceylon Kaffir’ oral history maintains some Africans returned to their homelands when each colonial regime was defeated. However, many ‘Ceylon Kaffirs’ remained on the island, sought families, and continued to serve the British in a conditionally “freed” capacity. Since Sri Lanka’s colonial era, these communities have come to be known by the ethnic and racial designation, ‘Ceylon Kaffirs,’ which although some scholars argue is not a pejorative term, finds its roots in colonial racist thought and practices. While this term signals both their African and Sri Lankan affiliations, it has become a point of contestation among the community owing to their increasing diasporic consciousness and global recognition. However, to document conceptions of selfhood and community affiliations as holistically, accurately, and in a culturally relevant manner among ‘Ceylon Kaffirs’ compels attention to their historical contextualization in Sri Lankan society just as it does to their present-day conceptions of being and belonging. ', 'Drawing upon concepts and theories in Africana Studies, African Diaspora Studies, and South Asian Studies, this dissertation is an investigation into selfhood, memory, aesthetics, coloniality, and spatiality among ‘Ceylon Kaffirs’ in Sri Lanka. Based on fieldwork carried out from July to December 2016 in Alankuda, Sirambi Adiya, and Puttalam town in the Puttalam district of contemporary Sri Lanka, I suggest that a focus on the forces of subjection as well as subjectivities yields a more nuanced narrative accounting for a range of influences, continuities, and fissures. This means that an examination of the present must be contextualized in the past. ', 'I contend that selfhood manifests in three distinct registers for ‘Ceylon Kaffirs’: African morphology, embodied expressions of memory-keeping activities, and ties to the national family. In addition, I argue that in the creation of meaning and substance in gama (home) within the Sri Lankan diasporic space, ‘Ceylon Kaffirs’ have not abandoned or rejected their Africanity in favor of assimilation to the local society. Rather, theirs is an evolving diasporic sentiment deeply rooted in the Afrodiasporic lives they have created and maintained through their reliance on African values, principles, and worldviews across multiple generations. Thus, I conclude that slavery, colonization, the African homeland, and the diaspora are all productive and resonant figures in ‘Ceylon Kaffir’ conceptions of the self and community that do not cause these Afrodiasporic peoples to vacillate within the classic binaries of African diaspora frameworks. Rather, their agentic and empowered expressions of being and belonging offer insight into a distinct Africana epistemology that is rooted in racial pride, self-determination, and an unwavering diasporic consciousness.']",1/1/2018,African-American Studies,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_586451\Jayawardene_northwestern_0163D_14155.pdf,,,,,,,

The research field of data visualization seeks design guidelines – often inspired by perceptual psychology – for more efficient visual data analysis. Data visualization can borrow phenomena, tasks, and methods of quantifying performance from perceptual psychology to guide effective visualization techniques and design practices. Perceptual psychology, on the other hand, benefits from such work by gaining new insight into the human visual system through new research questions rooted in real world problems. In Section 1, we evaluated a common guideline: when presenting multiple sets of values to a viewer, those sets should be distinguished not just by a single feature, such as color, but redundantly by multiple features, such as color and shape. Despite the broad use of this practice across maps and graphs, it may carry costs, and there is no direct evidence for a benefit. We show that this practice can indeed yield a large benefit for segmenting objects within a dense display in terms of accuracy of selection (Experiments 1 and 2), visual grouping strength of display elements (Experiment 3), and speed of selection in both abstract (Experiment 4) and realistic (Experiment 5) displays. These results show that the visual system can successfully attend to two visual features at once. The visual system can select objects with such features with greater precision and speed than when selecting objects defined by only one visual feature, and all despite the additional visual complexity. In Section 2, we explored how different ways of encoding pairs of data values can lead to vast differences in the efficiency of visually processing the relations between those pairs. We show that perceiving relations between individually-depicted data values leads to a highly inefficient process (Experiments 1a, 1b, 3), which makes it challenging to discriminate both the proportion of opposing relations (Experiments 2 and 4) and the magnitude of relations (Experiment 5). Considering the ubiquity of bar charts and dot plots, relation perception for individual data values is highly inefficient. We show that relations are extracted from pairs of objects in a serial manner. Our results also demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to ensemble code magnitude differences across object pairs, despite how serial this process is when searching for a single relation, and that relation perception is more efficient within an object than between two separate objects. Together, these studies reveal the strengths (Section 1) and weaknesses (Section 2) of visual attention while holding implications for encoding guidelines for data visualization for a range of tasks.']",1/1/2018,Psychology,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_586653\Nothelfer_northwestern_0163D_14157.pdf,,,,,,,

I hope to clarify how data about non-linguistic alignment - specifically, its fluency and the co-presence of an aligning partner - may inform expectations about the anticipated difficulty of interactions. These experiments test a claim from Pickering and Garrod’s (2004) Interactive Alignment framework: “alignment at one level leads to alignment at another level.” The experiments I present explore whether non-conversational alignment (or misalignment) carries over to linguistic performance - specifically, the way in which we express spatial perspective to others. This was accomplished using a quantitative approach to naturalistic conversations between adult pairs about simple spatial stimuli. The content of these conversations differs based on a task participants performed before the conversation that induced particular patterns of interpersonal alignment. These tasks were different for each experiment: Task 1 manipulated the dynamic stability of partners’ physical coordination with each other, Task 2 manipulated partners’ feelings of social similarity, Task 3 manipulated the dynamic stability of partners’ coordination with an external rhythm, and Task 4 manipulated the difficulty of collaborative or solo achievement of a physical goal. The results of these studies show that, in the absence of collaborative activity, social similarity and rhythmic entrainment can lead to greater conversational effort, but physical alignment enhances conversational alignment best when both partners’ actions are oriented toward a mutual goal.']",1/1/2018,Psychology,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_586673\Lysander_northwestern_0163D_14158.pdf,,,,,,,

The measurement of material density, compressibility, and elasticity at high P-T conditions provides thermoelastic parameters necessary to model seismic velocities in the Earth’s mantle at regional and global scales. In the first study, I determined the influence of hydration on thermoelasticity of majoritic garnet, an important silicate phase in the mantle transition zone (MTZ, 410-660 km depth). The MTZ is thought to potentially contain a large geochemical reservoir of H2O, bound in the crystal structures of nominally anhydrous minerals as hydroxyl (OH-) defects. My results show little or no effect of hydration on seismic velocities in or below the MTZ, suggesting that low-velocity anomalies recently observed below the transition zone beneath North America by Schmandt et al. (2014) and others are caused by dehydration melting of garnet as it transitions to bridgmanite at ~780 km depth.

From 9.5 to 35.5 GPa I observed the high-pressure clinoenstatite (HPCEN) phase and measured its P-V equation of state and structural evolution over an expanded pressure range relevant to pyroxene metatstability. At 45 GPa, I observed a phase transition to a new monoclinic form of Mg2Si2O6, called HPCEN2. Observation of HPCEN2 in Mg2Si2O6 is the third apex of the pyroxene quadrilateral to adopt this structure type at high-pressure, which has also been observed in Fe2Si2O6 (Pakhomova et al. 2017) and in MgCaSi2O6 (Plonka et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2016). In the third study I developed an optical microscope at Los Alamos National Laboratory to quantify the tensor of refractive indices (i.e. the indicatrix) in molecular crystals, and applied the new setup to determining the indicatrix and chromatic dispersion of acetaminophen (p-hydroxyacetanilide form I, commonly known as Tylenol®) as well as the orientation of the optical indicatrix in a monoclinic basis.

Knowledge of the elastic tensor of molecular crystals such as acetaminophen will improve models of mixtures of pharmaceuticals with binders under compression, potentially reducing the amount of binder necessary to produce tablets (Anderson, 2008; Toms et al., 2008; Ong et al., 2010).

Our metric is a natural extension of distance correlation proposed by Sze ́kely, Rizzo, and Bakirov (2007), which is used to measure the dependence between Y and X. The martingale difference correlation and its empirical counterpart inherit a number of desirable features of distance correlation and sample distance correlation, such as algebraic simplicity and elegant theoretical properties. We further use martingale difference correlation as a marginal utility to do high dimensional variable screening to screen out variables that do not contribute to the conditional mean of the response given the covariates. A further extension to conditional quantile screening is also described in detail and sure screening properties are rigorously justified. Both simulation results and real data illustrations demonstrate the effectiveness of martingale difference correlation based screening procedures in comparison with the correlation-based and distance correlation based counterparts.', 'In Chapter 2, we propose a general method for constructing confidence intervals and statistical tests for single or low-dimensional components of a large parameter vector in a high-dimensional linear model, where the dimension of the regression parameters may grow to infinity with the sample size.

It yields a nonsparse estimator which has a Gaussian limiting distribution and can be utilized to construct confidence intervals (regions). We give conditions under which the bootstrap provides asymptotic refinements to the coverage probabilities of confidence intervals. This procedure can be easily adjusted for any PLS estimator that has a cusp in the penalty term, such as SCAD, Adaptive Lasso, and minimax concave.

In Chapter 1, I examine the impact of competition from Chinese imports on innovation by U.S. public manufacturing firms. Exploiting cross-industry and over-time trade variations from 1991 to 2004, I find that when the influx of Chinese imports began, firms of different sizes responded differently. Large firms tended to increase their innovation, and shift into new technical fields and market segments where they faced less competition. This increase in innovation reflected, in part, a labor market adjustment: inventors moved from small firms to large firms. In contrast, small firms tended to reduce their R&D expenditures and suffered from a higher probability of exit.', ""In Chapter 2, I further analyze the labor market adjustment among inventors (across firms and geographic regions). I find that surging Chinese import penetration in a commuting zone spurred higher inventor mobility among the less productive, the more specialized, and the old. They were also more likely to patent in new technology classes when their field of specialization was exposed to higher Chinese import penetration. Such results are consistent with a story where these inventors were forced out of jobs either because their employers exited the market, or because their technical know-how didn't fit employers' strategic re-pivoting of their businesses. After moving to new workplaces, they adjusted their technical fields to meet firms' changing demand for high skilled labor. Such reallocation of inventors seem to be efficient because commuting zones increased their overall number of patents in response to higher Chinese import penetration."", ""In Chapter 3, I look at the flip of the coin and examine Chinese exporters' innovation response to China's exchange rate reform in 2005. The reform ended a decade-long peg of RMB to the U.S. dollar, appreciated RMB by 2.1% instantaneously, and started a managed floating exchange rate regime that set RMB on a long-term appreciation trajectory. This put Chinese exporters' under competitive pressure, and they may respond through innovation to survive. Based on a difference-in-difference approach, I find that Chinese exporters more exposed to the reform increased their number of patents relative to pre-reform level. Moreover, such an increase mainly occurred for utility patents and design patents while no change was found for invention patents. This seems to suggest that instead of producing highly innovative inventions, Chinese exporters mainly responded by improving their existing product lines with new features and design.""]",1/1/2018,Managerial Economics and Strategy,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_586980\Zhang_northwestern_0163D_14166.pdf,,,,,,,

A key component in marathon planning operations is the design of the marathon course to be followed during the race. In addition to the technical requirements regarding length and incline change, marathon courses must satisfy two additional requirements: (i) courses must visit certain neighborhoods in the city and (ii) they must be designed in such a way that access to the facilities that provide critical public service (e.g. hospitals) is not blocked by the tour. Motivated by marathon course design, this study develops models and approaches to solve multiobjective arc tour problems. The underlying tour finding problem, the Lock-Free Arc Tour Problem (LFATP), visits a predetermined set of edges while ensuring that the resulting tour does not block access to certain critical vertices. Apart from these restrictions, marathon course design involves a range of unique objective functions which we are classified under three categories: (i) arc-additive, (ii) sequence-dependent and (iii) time-dependent objective functions. In arc-additive functions, the objective contribution of each arc has a constant coefficient. In sequence-dependent ones, each arc's contribution to the objective depends on the other arcs used in the route and in time-dependent ones, each arc's contribution depends on when that arc is visited."", 'Initial efforts focus on the LFATP with arc-additive objectives as these objectives are relatively less complex compared to sequence- and time-dependent ones. The underlying problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program. Structurally, the LFATP suffers from excessive subtour formation, especially when the corresponding objective aims to minimize proximity to certain locations in the network, causing the standard branch-and-cut approach to perform poorly even with valid inequalities derived from locking properties of the LFATP. For this reason, we introduce path-based reformulations arising from a provably stronger disjunctive program, where disjunctions are obtained by fixing the visit orders in which must-visit edges are visited. In computational tests, the reformulations are shown to yield up to 100 times improvement in solution times. Additional tests demonstrate the benefits of using lock elimination inequalities and the value of reformulations for more general tour finding problems with visit requirements and length restrictions. Then, we extend the arc-additive model and its reformulations to handle objectives involving sequence- and time-dependent properties.', ""As marathon course design involves various objectives related to health, safety, performance and experience, LFATP needs to be solved in a multiobjective environment to identify the best course design for race organizers. For this reason, we introduce an Interactive Weight Region-Based approach (IWRA) that reaches a most preferred solution of the decision maker (DM) in multiobjective optimization. IWRA is an iterative approach which iterates between solution generation and comparison phases: At each iteration, IWRA presents a new solution to the DM by using weight diversification, obtained by solving an integer program. The DM's preference information is used to refine the unexplored weight region. We provide finitely converging algorithms solving the weighted sum problem for multiobjective linear programs and multiobjective integer programs. Different from existing approaches, IWRA separates weight generation and solution generation efforts, and provides a systematic weight generation scheme which is capable of exploring the entire weight region. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of IWRA under various settings and assumptions through comparisons with related methods from the literature which also ensure identification of optimal decisions. IWRA is also extended to the weighted Tchebycheff problem setting to handle unsupported nondominated solutions."", 'Finally, both tour finding and multiobjective projects are combined to generate a series of course designs for the Bank of America Chicago Marathon which serves the race organizers as a catalog of options. At this stage, we select the underlying LFATP formulation based on the dominant structure of the aggregated objective. The experiments show that significant improvements can be obtained by making relatively small changes to the existing course.']",1/1/2018,Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_587026\Basdere_northwestern_0163D_14168.pdf,,,,,,,

I  document several facts on  primary care markets and supplier  location decisions,  the types of patients physicians accept, the scale of their practices, their productivity and practice patterns, and their financial incentives. There is heterogeneity in financial incentives across consumers due to insurance coverage, and there is geographic variation in practice costs and  in payment regulations from Medicare and Medicaid. Primary care physicians are selective in the types of patients they accept: Medicare patients have greater access to primary care than low income  Medicaid Dual Eligible patients. Physicians are also less likely to accept  Medicare and Medicaid patients than those with private insurance, deriving most of their revenue from the private sector. The demographics and health of accepted patients vary across physicians. Geographic and within-location variation in physician practice patterns  evidence underlying dispersion in supplier productivity. Motivated by these data,  I adapt the economic theory of discrimination to explain rejection of willing customers, allowing for heterogeneity in  prices and cost across consumers and for dispersion in firm productivity. I analyze the empirical relationships between  scale,  productivity, and patient acceptance in the primary care population, and find that physicians who produce less  are more likely to discriminate. However,  conditional on some acceptance of both patient types, the relative proportion of low income patients is decreasing with scale.  The data and discrimination theory together imply Dual Eligible patients have lower marginal cost compared to Medicare patients, but have higher fixed or sunk  costs, and that this cost wedge is closing as physician productivity grows. Finally, observing geographic variation in output price regulations and input costs, I exploit physician migration to identify the effects of financial incentives on patient acceptance, scale, and practice patterns.  I find that physicians are more likely to accept more profitable patients.  However, omnibus  environmental factors subsuming  prices explain less than half of the change in physician behavior upon  migration.  I use a structural supply model to estimate the  idiosyncratic financial incentives affecting production choices and acceptance of Medicare and Medicaid Dual Eligible patients. As expected, I find that Dual Eligibles have lower marginal cost of primary care compared to Medicare patients. Estimated  marginal cost is dispersed across suppliers within a given market. The regression results and structural cost estimates together imply that equalizing  prices for Dual Eligible and Medicare patients would erase the primary care access gap for low income elders.

These concerns can be addressed from a chemical perspective by studying how emerging nanomaterials interact with biological systems. Fundamentally, the key interactions for nanomaterial uptake into a cell occurs at the nano/bio interface. This interface is difficult to access experimentally, mainly because traditional methods used to probe these interactions do not provide molecular information, are not interface-specific, or are not sensitive enough to detect small surface coverages, even at saturation. As a result, the amount of molecular information regarding how nanoparticles interact with aqueous/solid interfaces, including biological membranes, is limited. There exists therefore an urgent need to bridge this knowledge gap by probing the nano/bio interface with new tools. The motivation of this thesis is to address this need by using advanced spectroscopic techniques that will improve our ability to understand, control, and predict how emerging nanomaterials will impact the environment and biological systems. Herein we take a bottom-up approach to better understand, from a fundamental perspective, what factors contribute to nano/bio interactions.', 'The interactions that take place at the nano/bio interface are directly influenced by the chemistry of the biological surface, the properties of the nanomaterial (size, shape, functionalization, surface charge, charge density, etc.), and environmental conditions (ionic strength, pH, temperature, etc.).

The consumer protection origins of the war on drugs illustrate and illuminate this process, revealing how and why U.S. laws now police some Americans with power originally intended to protect others.

The first chapter investigates how the retirement slowdown among older Americans has affected the labor market prospects of younger Americans in recent decades. Using an instrumental variables approach exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in the age composition of the old across U.S. commuting zones, I find that the retirement slowdown has had a negative impact on the composition of jobs among the young. In commuting zones where fewer older workers retire due to the initial age structure, youth employment in high-skill occupations declines while youth employment in low-skill occupations increases. The estimates imply that the retirement slowdown can account for up to 60 percent of the rise of youth employment in low-skill jobs between 1990 and 2007. This pattern of occupational downgrading is consistent with a model of the labor market featuring occupational choice, and the fact that older workers are increasingly concentrated in high-skill jobs. I also find evidence of declining youth wages and a shift towards part-time employment among the young. Together, the results suggest that retirement trends have contributed to stagnant youth labor market prospects in recent years.', ""The second chapter, joint work with Daniel Fetter and Lee Lockwood, explores the relationship between government old-age support and transfers within the family by investigating the Old Age Assistance Program (OAA), a means-tested and state-administered pension program created by the Social Security Act of 1935.

Our results suggest that OAA reduced intergenerational co-residence among both elderly men and elderly women, enough to explain most or all of the aggregate decline between 1930 and 1940, and lay the foundation for future work using linked Census samples to investigate the impact of OAA on recipients' children and their families."", ""The third chapter, joint work with Enrico Berkes and Bledi Taska, investigates how initial skill-specific labor market conditions affect early career outcomes of college graduates. Using data on the near-universe of online job postings in the U.S. between 2010 and 2016, we build a new measure of skill mismatch which captures how well an individual's college major matches the occupational composition of local labor demand around the time of graduation. Intuitively, a college graduate experiences skill mismatch when only a small fraction of online job postings in her city are suitable for her major in the year she graduates. Exploiting variation in skill mismatch across majors, cities and graduation cohorts, we find that a one standard deviation increase in our measure leads to a 3 percent decline in initial wages. Skill mismatch is also associated with a greater probability of being initially unemployed or employed in a part-time job, as well as a lower probability of being employed in a college occupation or one of the top occupations by college major. While the effects on unemployment, part-time employment and employment in college occupations gradually fade over time, the effects on wages and major-occupation fit persist up to 6 years after graduation.

PCOS presents with features of hyperandrogenism, irregular menses and polycystic ovaries.  Twin and family studies have demonstrated high heritability estimates for PCOS.  Consequently, a number of common genetic PCOS susceptibility loci have been reproducibly mapped using family-based association tests or GWAS.  However, taken together, these loci only account for a small fraction of PCOS heritability, analogous to findings in other complex traits/diseases.  One hypothesis for the observed deficit in heritability is that uncommon or rare genetic variants with greater phenotypic effects contribute to disease pathogenesis.  We tested this hypothesis using an unbiased whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach followed by targeted resequencing of a gene panel including 11 PCOS candidates in a case/control cohort.  Subsequent in silico analyses yielded PCOS-associated rare genetic variants, both in coding and noncoding regions of the genome. ', 'Two of the 11 panel genes included anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and its specific type II receptor (AMHR2).  Women affected with PCOS often have elevated levels of AMH.  In the ovary AMH inhibits follicle maturation, thus the elevated AMH levels seen in women with PCOS are consistent with the observed arrested folliculogenesis.  Paradoxically, AMH also inhibits androgen production through transcriptional repression of CYP17, a rate-limiting enzyme in steroidogenesis.  This suggests a loss of AMH function in PCOS, a phenotype of androgen excess.  Identified coding and select noncoding variants of AMH and AMHR2 were studied to determine their functional impact on signaling ability.  Using dual luciferase reporter assays and quantitative real-time PCR, we identified a total of 37 PCOS-specific variants in AMH and AMHR2 that displayed a significant reduction in activity.  Collectively, 50 PCOS cases harbored functionally validated pathogenic variants, equating to 7.1% (50/700) of our case cohort.  None of the variants observed in control women had impaired signaling activity.  Our findings are the first to identify and functionally validate rare genetic variants associated with a common PCOS phenotype and suggest a previously unrecognized mechanism for the role of AMH in PCOS: decreased AMH bioactivity.', 'Given that PCOS is a complex disorder with a heterogeneous presentation, several genes and pathways likely lead to various PCOS phenotypes.  Analyses of targeted resequencing data also identified predicted deleterious missense variants, specific to PCOS cases, mapping to the LMNA and INSR genes that encode the lamin A/C and insulin receptor, respectively.  Mutations in these genes cause disorders associated with extreme phenotypes of PCOS.  Our results indicate that rare variants in LMNA and INSR also account for a subgroup of PCOS-affected women.']",1/1/2018,Driskill Graduate Training Program in Life Sciences,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_587301\Gorsic_northwestern_0163D_14177.pdf,,,,,,,

Anchored in the archives, this dissertation investigates the quiet prevalence of Atlantic Quakerism in the early literature of the hemispheric Americas, moving through the nineteenth century. The project argues that the lived practices of Quaker people are essential to resolving the enduring paradox of Quakerism’s relationship to American literature: while Quaker people figure prominently in the colonial histories of New England, Pennsylvania, and the Carolinas, as well as Barbados and Jamaica, and appear widely in major works of American literature into the nineteenth century, the critical study of Quakerism in these histories has been quieted, relegated to a muted backbeat of Protestant Puritanism’s melodic legacy. The “silence” of the title denotes both the methods and stakes of my project. At once, it invokes the lived Quaker practice of silent worship, while also naming the critical, field-specific absence that the project undertakes to address. This project pursues constitutional questions about what and who composes Quakerism in the seventeenth and eighteenth century. It asks how Quakerism was understood by Friends, as well as how the Society of Friends was seen, articulated, and used by those who were drawn to it. From Barbados and Pennsylvania, to the unanchored Nantucket whaleship, this investigation ranges over the significant impact Quakerism has on American literary history and argues for the complexity of Quaker life within the archives of American literature.']",1/1/2018,English,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_587325\High_northwestern_0163D_14178.pdf,,,,,,,

I hypothesized that engineering the microenvironment of ectocervical tissue with in vivo-like endocrine and paracrine support, would enable squamous differentiation and hormone response. An interdisciplinary approach was taken to generate and characterize three distinct microphysiologic tissue culture models to study hormone-action in the human cervix. These microphysiologic models mimicked many aspects of in vivo physiology, including squamous maturation, hormone response, and mucin production, which are important components of barrier defense. Additionally, mRNA transcripts for several mucins not previously reported in the ectocervix and the differentiation-dependent localization of known ectocervical mucins were identified in both native and engineered tissue. To investigate genomic pathways that may influence physiology and infectivity during the menstrual cycle, RNA sequence analysis was performed on patient-matched engineered tissue after follicular and luteal phase hormone treatments. Follicular phase hormones were associated with proliferation, transcription, and cell adhesion, while luteal phase samples expressed genes involved in immune cell recruitment, inflammation, and protein modifications. In summary, I developed three microphysiologic human ectocervical tissue models that differentiate, produce mucins, and respond to hormones, and defined ovarian hormone-action in the human ectocervix during the menstrual cycle, highlighting potential mechanisms that may influence infectivity. This will be useful for a variety of research applications, such as drug development and toxicology studies, development of preventative and therapeutic treatments, and basic research on hormone action in a critical reproductive tissue for women’s health that has been historically understudied.']",1/1/2018,Driskill Graduate Training Program in Life Sciences,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_587328\McKinnon_northwestern_0163D_14179.pdf,,,,,,,

The result is that incorporating scientific attitudes into differential psychology remains a challenge and continues to be a barrier in collaboration between qualitative and quantitative disciplines."", 'The purpose of this research was to propose and validate a framework for assessing and understanding individual differences in attitudes about science.  In addition to developing and validating a revised assessment of scientific attitudes, this work incorporates research on personality traits, cognitive ability, and motivational interests (i.e., TAI) in order to provide integration with various approaches in differential psychology. The result is a framework for assessing scientific attitudes that can enable collaboration between education sciences, cognitive psychologists, and differential psychologists and additionally serve as a basis for further research on the role of traits, abilities, and interests in developing and predicting interest in science.', 'In Chapter 2, we examined the psychometric properties of the SAI-II using factor analysis and item response theory.  Study 1 (N = 301, 134 men) supported a 4-factor structure in which many items had good discrimination and high item information values.  The proposed measure of scientific attitudes, the SAI-III, was derived from iterative factor analyses in Chapter 2 conducted on items from the SAI-II and can be scored as 4 separate scales. It is argued that the SAI-III scales can be integrated into existing constructs of personality, ability, and interests and provide incremental information over the existing constructs.  Study 2 (N = 2,324, 808 men) replicated the structure of Study 1 and examined its structural validity using a diverse online sample. Our results suggest interpreting scientific attitudes as a multidimensional construct using the scales of Interest in Science, Understanding of Science, Science Leads to Answers, and Openness to Science. In Chapter 3, concurrent and convergent validity of the proposed SAI-III scales was established using assessments for personality traits, cognitive ability, and vocational interests. Meaningful correlations were found for Openness-Intellect as well as all domains of cognitive ability as measured by the International Cognitive Ability Resource.  Chapter 4 then concludes by using a large national sample  collected by Project TALENT to examine associations of temperament, ability, and interests with scientific attitudes as measured by the Project TALENT INVENTORY.  Results partially replicate the patterns of associations of ability and temperament between the SAI-III and measures of TAI, although the magnitudes of the patterns differ between samples. Differences between samples could indicate that temperament guides interest in science throughout high school, whereas ability plays a larger role in adulthood.  Taken together, this work proposes a framework for understanding scientific attitudes embedded in differential psychology and provides a public-domain measure of assessing scientific attitudes that can serve as an initial framework across disciplines of education science and psychology.']",1/1/2018,Psychology,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 12/22/2018",Private,\etdadmin_upload_587391\French_northwestern_0163D_14180.pdf,,,,,,,

It demonstrates how a substantive theoretical attention to these jumps generates possibilities for thinking about black radical politics differently. Through death, mobility, destruction, and escape, the jump communicates criticisms of the existing anti-black world. This dissertation argues that the form of total refusal enacted in the slave jumping from the slave ship contains an anatomy of black anarchism that can be seen in other areas of challenge or interruption to colonial-racial regimes regulating the location and mobility of black populations including the voyages of the Black Star Line, the 1965 Watts Rebellion, and Assata Shakur’s escape from prison. In its other forms, the jumps elaborate the collective, cataclysm, and abolition. In tracing this lineage of black anarchism through the spatial environments it contests, this dissertation also presents a different origin story of our carceral state. Each chapter illustrates the slave ship’s legacy of black confinement, demonstrating how its principles have been reinscribed in various institutional forms so as to extend the state of capture. In so doing, this dissertation contends that contemporary spatialities of anti-black discipline, from enslavement to mass incarceration, are better understood when we begin with the slave ship rather than colorblind conceptions of the convict ship or the panopticon. The purpose is to examine the ways that both detention and mobility are twinned necessities in the racial regimes of the modern era as well as indicate how processes of confinement constitute racial and gendered hierarchies. In addition, this dissertation argues that while localized, exertions of spatial disruption work to institute new social relations and ways of being that exist both against the colonial-racial state and Western norms of political participation as world-questioning politics.']",1/1/2018,African-American Studies,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2019",Private,\etdadmin_upload_587392\Tenorio_northwestern_0163D_14181.pdf,,,,,,,

', 'The first chapter is concerned with methodological aspects of machine learning, namely the design of new distributed optimization algorithms, whereas the last two chapters consider applications of machine learning that lie at the interface of social network analysis and marketing. ', 'The motivation for the first chapter is that in recent years, the size of data sets has exceeded the disk and memory capacities', 'of a single computer. This has created the need to employ parallel and distributed computing in order to perform critical machine learning tasks. Given that optimization is one of the pillars of machine learning and predictive modeling, distributed optimization methods have recently garnered ample attention in the literature. Although previous research has mostly focused on settings in which either the observations, or features of the problem at hand are stored in distributed fashion, the situation where both are partitioned across the nodes of a computer cluster (doubly distributed) has not been studied extensively. We propose two doubly distributed optimization algorithms. The first falls under the umbrella of distributed dual coordinate ascent methods, while the second belongs to the class of stochastic gradient/coordinate descent hybrid methods. We conduct numerical experiments in Spark using real-world and simulated data sets and study the scaling properties of our methods. Our empirical evaluation of the proposed algorithms demonstrates the outperformance of a block distributed ADMM method, which, to the best of our knowledge is the only other existing doubly distributed optimization algorithm.', ""The second and third chapters address two fundamental problems in marketing: customer retention, and product adoption, respectively. In the second chapter, we explore the power of social networks in predicting non-contractual customer behavior. The last decade has seen a rapid emergence of non-subscription-based services. Predicting spending patterns in such settings is particularly challenging due to the capricious purchasing behavior that customers often exhibit. We study the extent to which knowledge of a customer's social network can enhance the accuracy of forecasting their behavior in terms of future: (1) activity, (2) transaction levels and (3) membership to the group of best customers. We conduct a dynamic analysis on a sample of approximately one million users from the most popular peer-to-peer (P2P) payment application, Venmo. Our models produce high quality forecasts and demonstrate that social networks lead to a significant boost in predictive performance primarily during the first month of a customer's lifetime, thus providing a remedy to the “cold-start” problem. Finally, we characterize significant structural differences with regard to network centrality, density and connectivity between the top 10\\% and bottom 90\\% of users immediately after joining the service. We discuss how these structural dissimilarities provide a path towards proactive marketing and improved customer acquisition efforts."", 'In the third chapter, using the same data set as in the second chapter, we investigate the structural aspects behind the adoption of Venmo. The most distinct quality of our data set is that Venmo transactions reflect offline activities combined with the scale of the online world. We use the framework of structural virality, which has primarily been utilized in the spread of online content, as a vehicle to investigate the diffusion of an offline product. Structural virality serves as a tool for differentiating between the two main forms of diffusion, namely a single broadcast that reaches directly a large number of people, and a viral mechanism that follows a more organic, P2P growth. We explore the nature of adopting Venmo from two perspectives: the traditional approach that considers adoption to be a binary event, and a holistic approach that takes into account the behavior of users in the post-adoption period. Our key finding indicates that not all adoptions are equal. More specifically, our results show that broadcast and viral mechanisms are positively correlated with the speed of diffusion and user engagement, respectively. In the face of this trade-off, we build a model to predict broadcast and viral structures, which can help stakeholders proactively devise network interventions that best suit their objectives.']",1/1/2018,Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_587433\Nathan_northwestern_0163D_14183.pdf,,,,,,,

During the Koszider Period of the Middle Bronze Age in Central Europe, long-occupied settlements were reorganized, communities became dispersed, and millennium-old cemeteries ceased to be used. In light of the revolutionary transformations in social organization and political economy, locating the actions of individuals and communities, and understanding the political discourse about emerging trade, subsistence, community, and identities is crucial. Yet archaeology has remained largely blind to those shaping and enacting change. I argue mortuary ritual offers an ideal locus within which to study public discourse and political negotiation on the smallest scale. By analyzing events within the cemetery of Kajászó, and within individual funerals, I recover the micro-political contributions of mourners to the large-scale transformations at the end of the Middle Bronze Age.', 'The purpose of the dissertation is manifold. First, explanations for social change in Central European Bronze Age tend to focus on political economic change at the scale of the region and community. Within these accounts, events such as the abandonment of settlements appear without explanation, viewed through its effect, and fail to take into consideration how people occupying the settlements affected such transformations. Second, I argue micro-politics are best located within the mortuary domain. Cemeteries offer insight into singular funerary occasions — public occurrences of consequence. When studied sequentially and in relation to each other, burials may become frames of a filmstrip depicting political processes on a human scale. Central European Bronze Age cemeteries are, however, poorly utilized because of a methodological inability to locate them, and because discrepancies between ritual as theoretically conceptualized and analytically realized cast them as static, unchanging and reflective, the mere enactment of prescribed mortuary liturgy. In this dissertation, I develop a theoretical and methodological framework, and present a multiscalar historical processualist approach better suited to the study of cemeteries.', 'Bronze Age cemeteries are hard to find, most often uncovered inadvertently during construction. The inability to systematically locate cemeteries — unlike settlements — leads to an analytical approach characterized by broad statistical analysis and uncritical comparison, during which a few well known cemeteries are used as templates to fill the often-empty slot of the funerary domain. My methodological framework, involving geophysical survey combined with systematic shovel test pitting and predictive modeling, allows for the reliable mapping of cemeteries. Furthermore, for decades, scholars have conceptualized rituals as active, political loci. However, few studies apply theoretical conceits to excavation and analysis with sufficient rigor. My research recovers micro-scale politics within the cemetery and within burials by sequencing micro-events and discourse as enacted within and between funerals.', 'Finally, I propose a new theoretical framework considering the ways in which discourse enacted within sequences of ritual contributes to social change. Rather than focus on monumental events and their aftermath, I consider the flows and ruptures that accumulate in change. I argue the mortuary domain is particularly well-suited to such an approach, offering a liminal space within which mourners gain situational authority to act and be recognized, regardless of their status in the domain of everyday life. My theoretical contributions allow for a historical perspective that considers how the actions of individuals at moments of heightened significance affect the transformation of society.']",1/1/2018,Anthropology,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_587437\Polanyi_northwestern_0163D_14184.pdf,,,,,,,

Specifically, I propose that uncertainty provides a basis for individuals to make forward-looking inferences, which I term projections, about both the benefits and costs of information. Due to these projections, individuals’ desire to seek information can peak at moderate levels of uncertainty, rather than at high levels of uncertainty. Five experiments and data from a large-scale field survey find evidence consistent with this perspective.

Broadly speaking, the seller chooses an auction if the expected number of buyers is high and negotiations otherwise.  Empirical implications of the theory are (i) The revenue is higher if  buyer valuations are less volatile; (ii) More risk-averse sellers choose auctions more often; (iii) If the seller risk-aversion is above (below) a threshold value, the average transaction price in auctions is greater (less) than that in negotiations.

First, when the product markets are very similar, there is a high chance that antitrust investigations will block the merger. We find that this effect is stronger in markets that are more concentrated and in years where antitrust regulatory intensity is high. Second, the synergies from the merger are less if the product markets are very related.

The idea motivating this study stems from the observation of the mixed record of state cooperation with ICC operations. For legal professionals and scholars this observation is puzzling, since states falling within the ICC 3territorial jurisdiction are legally bound to provide full judicial assistance to the Court. Why do some countries entertain collaborative relations with the ICC while others display hostility towards it? I argue that state leaders’ perceptions of potential ICC indictment best explain variation in state behavior. The academic payoff of this project is a better understanding of how state attitudes form and to what extent external actors, spearheaded by the ICC Prosecutor’s Office (OTP) can change them. Preliminary findings suggest: First, formal state consent (e.g. ratification) is not a reliable predictor of state cooperation; Second, democracies are more likely than non-democracies to cooperate initially, yet regime type does not play a role in enhancing judicial cooperation when this is not forthcoming; Third, state leaders’ perceptions of potential ICC indictment correctly predict state behavior in all the situations investigated by the OTP; Fourth, the OTP’s signaling strategy—including the timing of ICC intervention—affects state leaders’ perceptions of future ICC indictment and, in turn, the prospects of state cooperation; Finally, when state authorities deny cooperation, regime change provides a one-time opportunity to start ICC-relations anew. My theoretical framework is linked to empirical analysis through a comparative study of three country cases: Colombia, Guinea, and Côte d’Ivoire.

Given the United States’ relatively low standings in science and math compared to similar industrialized nations and its desire to be competitive in an increasingly STEM-based global economy, policy makers are calling for more creative ways to encourage interest in STEM from a young age. In response to this call, there has been a recent surge in educational television shows that claim to support early STEM skills. While high-quality educational television can stimulate interest in topics that young children might not otherwise encounter (Fisch, 2004), the impact of STEM television programming on young children’s interest in STEM has not yet been empirically established. ', 'In the U.S., interest in STEM is especially low for female and minority children, which leads to less STEM participation for these groups later in life (National Science Board, 2010). These gender and race gaps are likely exacerbated by the mass media; content analyses reveal that characters engaging in math and science on TV are overwhelmingly male and White (Long, Boiarsky, & Thayer, 2001). Stereotypical portrayals not only impact the self-efficacy of girls and children of color, they also lead to society-wide beliefs about who can and should participate in STEM (Bandura, 1986b; Gerbner, 1998). However, there is potential for counter-stereotypical portrayals to counteract these traditional stereotypes (Aubrey & Harrison, 2004). Some educational television shows created in recent years have begun to feature more diverse characters, but the effect of these positive portrayals is yet unknown. The goals of this dissertation are to understand the current landscape of characters featured in STEM television for young children and to investigate whether children’s engagement with these programs can have a positive impact on their attitudes towards STEM. ', 'Study 1 presents a content analysis of 1,086 characters in 30 STEM-focused television shows for children ages 3-6 (three episodes per show, 90 episodes total). Results show that compared to the U.S. population, female and minority characters are underrepresented. Male characters are correspondingly overrepresented; however, White characters are not. This imbalance is caused by the inclusion of many racially ambiguous characters and characters with non-human skin colors. No significant differences by gender or race were found for characters’ on-screen STEM engagement or prominence in the show. Representation becomes more equal when looking only at child characters, suggesting that recent efforts to increase the diversity of character portrayals have been somewhat successful. ', 'Study 2 presents a pre/post, between-subjects experimental investigation of the effect of repeated exposure (8 weeks, 2-3 times per week) to a STEM television show that features a diverse group of highly STEM-engaged characters on children’s (N = 48, Mage = 6.57 years) attitudes towards STEM, gender and race-based occupational attitudes, and self-identification with STEM behaviors. Though no differences were found between treatment and control groups, several individual differences emerged as significant predictors of attitude change. Children who were more familiar with STEM television shows at pretest had less positive STEM attitudes at posttest, likely due to their greater consumption of more stereotypical programming. Children who had a greater understanding of the educational intent of the stimulus program and children who developed strong relationships with the stimulus characters experienced more positive STEM attitude change from pretest to posttest. ', 'Results of the two studies suggest that exposure to diverse portrayals of STEM occupations is important, and that today’s STEM television landscape does provide some diversity in terms of gender and race. However, results also suggest that one strong counter-stereotypical example may not be sufficient to change children’s worldviews about what types of people hold STEM careers. An overrepresentation of diverse, counter-stereotypical portrayals may be needed in order for children to believe that people of all genders and races belong in STEM.']",1/1/2018,Communication Studies,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_587545\Alade_northwestern_0163D_14189.pdf,,,,,,,

Unlike other multipotent stem cell populations present at this time, neural crest stem cells are not restricted to a specific germ layer, and they retain their pluripotent potential while other neighboring cells are becoming further restricted. How neural crest cells evade the push to become lineage restricted, however, is unclear. Thus, studies of this important cell population will provide insight into the molecular underpinnings of stem cell potency and advance our understanding of how cell fate decisions are regulated in the early embryo. ', 'In this thesis, I explore how stem cell attributes are controlled in pluripotent blastula stem cells and investigate how this relates to the mechanism by which neural crest cells retain their stemness during embryonic development. I found that FGF signaling is required for proper blastula-stage gene expression and the appropriate lineage restriction of these cells, and that FGF signals execute context-dependent effects by differentially activating two different downstream signaling cascades. For instance, the MAPK cascade is active in blastula stem cells and is required for the pluripotency of these cells, while the PI3K/Akt cascade is required for the transit of cells to a subset of lineage restricted cell states. I further discovered that neural crest stem cells retain high MAPK:low Akt activity, and that this is required for proper establishment of the neural crest. In order to address how this differential cascade activation is achieved, I investigated the role of signaling adaptors and found that levels of the adaptor proteins Sos1 and Gab1 are critically important for activation of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades. Additionally, I discovered that Sos1 is required for proper embryonic patterning and is essential for blastula-stage pluripotency. Together, my findings detail the different roles of FGF signals throughout early embryonic patterning and demonstrate a novel mechanism by which this pathway elicits context-specific effects during cell fate determination.']",1/1/2018,Interdepartmental Biological Sciences (IBiS) Graduate Program,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_587570\GearyBowman_northwestern_0163D_14192.pdf,,,,,,,

The first essay draws from the National Inventory of the Collateral Consequences of Conviction (NICCC) to trace the historical emergence of state laws that enact criminal background checks for noncriminal justice purposes. The essay examines the impact of these cumulative policy changes on the system of criminal history record access in the United States, showing that the result of background check proliferation has been a functional reorientation of the criminal history record system toward social screening – the formal use of criminal records to determine eligibility for a broad range of institutional attachments, such as employment, professional licenses, housing, and civic and political participation. The second essay uses an original panel data set to examine the extensiveness of background screening regimes at the state level. The essay tests the role of racial economic threat and late modern punitiveness in driving the adoption of background check provisions. Additionally, the essay develops and tests a third framework - racialized risk amplification - which suggests that background check provisions will be become more extensive as African Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. The results support the racialized risk perspective, finding that African-American prison composition is a strong positive predictor of', 'background check adoption. Yet, the results also reveal that neither racial economic threat nor state-level punitiveness increase the adoption rate. The findings carry implications for understanding the formal construction of stigma and the intersecting roles of race and crime and in the arrangement of American social institutions. The third essay draws from legislative discourse in the Illinois General Assembly to examine how policymakers justify background check laws. This essay puts forward an endogenous account of constructing criminal risk, showing that lawmakers justified new background check laws largely as a means of filling security loopholes created by prior legislation. While the laws respond to identified criminal risks, the process of expanding background checks itself draws attention to other dimensions of vulnerability, demanding the addition of new screening requirements. Incremental expansions are further justified on the basis of background screening’s low cost, which, lawmakers argue, creates an obligation to extend the laws wherever vulnerabilities are identified, particularly when children are potential victims and sex offenders the possible villains. The essay shows how security and vulnerability are mutually generative in the area of background screening, and discusses implications for understanding this legal form in the context of contemporary American penality.']",1/1/2018,Sociology,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 06/22/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_587632\McElhattan_northwestern_0163D_14193.pdf,,,,,,,

The first study examines peer context, namely the academic strength of classmates, and its relationship to math coursework, educational aspirations, and college application choices. While some prior research showed that there might be some “hidden risks” to having more talented peers, this research finds benefits of having peers with higher levels of academic achievement in this context.

Overall, the findings suggest that students should primarily focus on college applications and FAFSA rather than the uncertain payoff of scholarship applications.', 'The final study aims to understand the institutional attributes that are attractive to CPS students when making enrollment decisions. Using conditional logistic regression models, analyses find that students are attracted to institutions that are closer to home, have lower tuition costs, are an “academic match” to their own qualifications, and are at the high or low end of the selectivity spectrum. While recent research has focused on the propensity of low-income students to “undermatch” based on their academic qualifications, these analyses point to the importance of taking into consideration a number of institutional, non-academic characteristics when trying to understand students’ enrollment choices.']",1/1/2018,Sociology,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_587642\Becker_northwestern_0163D_14194.pdf,,,,,,,

As the toxicity mechanism of nanomaterials may vary fundamentally from their bulk material counterparts due to specific nanoparticle properties, the environmental consequences of these materials need to be kept in mind as new materials are developed. When nanomaterials encounter unicellular and multicellular organism in the environment, the surface of the nanoparticles and the surface of the cell membrane are the first points of contact. Therefore, understanding the molecular level interactions at the nano-bio interface can provide insight into the mechanisms of nanotoxicity. However, it is difficult to elucidate specific molecular level information regarding the interactions between nanomaterials and cell membranes, given the inherently complex nature of the surface chemistries.

It studies the optimal evaluation of a complex project of uncertain quality by sampling a limited number of its attributes. The project is described by a unit mass of correlated attributes, of which only one is observed initially. Optimal sampling and adoption is characterized for both single-agent and principal-agent evaluation. In the former, sampling is guided by the initial attribute but it is unaffected by its realization. Sequential and simultaneous sampling are equivalent. The optimal sample balances the variability of sampled attributes with their usefulness in inferring neighboring attributes. Under principal-agent evaluation, the realization of the initial attribute informs sampling so as to better influence adoption. Sampling hinges on (i) its informativeness for the principal, and (ii) the variation of the agent’s posterior belief explained by the principal’s posterior belief. Optimal sampling is not necessarily a compromise between the players’ ideal samples. I identify conditions under which mild disagreement leads to excessively risky or conservative sampling. Yet, drastic disagreement always induces compromise.', 'The second chapter, which is joint work with Yingni Guo, analyzes the problem of a fully committed sender who seeks to sway a collective adoption decision through designing experiments. Voters have correlated payoff states and heterogeneous thresholds of doubt. We characterize the sender-optimal policy under unanimity rule for two persuasion modes. Under general persuasion, evidence presented to each voter depends on all voters’ states. The sender makes the most demanding voters indifferent between decisions, while the more lenient voters strictly benefit from persuasion. Under individual persuasion, evidence presented to each voter depends only on her state. The sender designates a subgroup of rubber-stampers, another of fully informed voters, and a third of partially informed voters. The most demanding voters are strategically accorded high-quality information.', 'The third chapter returns to the problem of attribute discovery by allowing for a larger class of distributions and attribute weights. An object considered for adoption is characterized by finitely many attributes, which follow an arbitrary jointly normal distribution. The analysis takes a network-theoretic approach to characterize the optimal sample of attributes by making use of the representation of the distribution as a Gaussian Markov Random Field. The main contribution of the analysis lies in the construction of a novel centrality measure within this correlation graph – inference centrality – that captures the success of a sample in leading to the correct adoption decision. Inference centrality has a number of novel properties compared to other standard centrality notions: it is naturally defined over both single nodes and subsets of nodes, it considers all paths in the graph, and path discounting reflects the particular nature of the inference problem. I show that the inference centrality of a sample depends on (i) the inference value of each sampled attribute for unsampled attributes, (ii) the marginal precision of each sampled attribute, and (iii) the intra-connectedness of the sample. I then use the concept of inference centrality to characterize the optimal sample in two multi-player settings of separate sampling and adoption decisionmaking.']",1/1/2018,Economics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_588115\Bardhi_northwestern_0163D_14197.pdf,,,,,,,

First, I investigate whether media coverage affects voluntary disclosure decisions. Second, I address endogeneity issues related to my analysis. Third, I examine the relation between media sentiment and voluntary disclosure.', 'In Chapter 1, I investigate whether and how media coverage affects the quantity of voluntary disclosure provided by managers. Controlling for firm characteristics including past disclosure behavior, I find that prior media coverage is positively associated with both the likelihood of issuing management guidance and the quantity of guidance issued. The relation between media coverage and guidance is stronger for articles that purely disseminate information than articles that provide additional commentary, and is strongly associated with the presence of institutional investors, consistent with the media increasing investor demand for disclosure. In addition, the effect of media coverage is stronger when the articles come from more credible news sources. Firms with more media coverage are also significantly more likely to hold earnings conference calls, speak more during conference calls, and issue more press releases, which suggests that media coverage has an impact across multiple voluntary disclosure channels.', 'In Chapter 2, I use several causal inference techniques to address endogeneity issues in my analysis. First, I use the setting of S&P 500 index inclusions to examine the effect of changes in media coverage on changes in voluntary disclosure. Using a difference-in-difference research design to isolate the effect of changes in media coverage on voluntary disclosure, I find corroborating evidence that increases in media coverage due to inclusions lead to increases in guidance provided by newly added index firms. Second, I use several instrumental variables to further address endogeneity in my measurement of media coverage and find additional support for my findings. Third, I find consistent evidence using an entropy balancing matching approach.', 'In Chapter 3, I examine the effect of media sentiment on managers’ propensity to issue guidance. Using a measure of media sentiment derived from multiple automated sentiment analysis techniques from Ravenpack News Analytics, I find that firms are more (less) likely to provide management guidance when they receive more positive (negative) tone articles in the media. This is consistent with the hypothesis that during optimistic (pessimistic) periods, investors scrutinize disclosures less (more) rigorously, which decreases (increases) disclosure-related costs. Moreover, I find that the effect of media sentiment is stronger when there are more media articles covering the firm, consistent with the notion that the effect of media sentiment matters more when there is greater dissemination of the news.', 'Taken together, my study documents new evidence that media coverage plays an important role in influencing voluntary disclosure decisions by affecting the demand for public disclosure.

Therefore, mice with Tregs-specific ablation of Hrd1 displayed massive multi-organ lymphocyte infiltration, body weight loss, and the development of severe small intestine inflammation with aging. Taken together, these findings indicate that Hrd1 is crucial to maintain both T effector and Treg cell function and differentiation. Given that Hrd1 is upregulated upon TCR stimulation, and both the conventional and regulatory T cells are developed from the same pool of thymocyte progenitor cells, we were curious about how engagement of the same E3 ligase in these two related cell types execute such different mechanisms. We found that in T effector cells, Hrd1 facilitated T-cell growth through degradation of cyclin-CDK inhibitor p27kip1, and deletion of p27kip1 in Hrd1-null T-cells rescued their defect in proliferation.  While in Tregs, the deletion of Hrd1 led to up-regulation of the ER stress sensor, IRE1 , and specific inhibition of IRE1  kinase rescued impaired Treg induction by Hrd1 deletion.

Existing literature demonstrates links between housing, urban governance, perceptions of dilapidated buildings, and racial and economic stratification.  Less is known, however, about the intermediary actors who work at the nexus of on-the-ground interpretative processes and city-wide regulation.  Building on urban sociology, cultural sociology, political sociology, and legal geography, I ask 1) what do inspectors take into consideration – about the social characteristics of residents, landlords, and property owners – when deciding what to do when their inspections turn up violations; 2) how do inspectors interpret physical characteristics of buildings; and 3) how do inspectors’ decisions aggregate to either reproduce or ameliorate existing inequalities in the city?  To answer these questions, I draw on ethnographic observations of inspections in action, neighborhood ethnography, courtroom observations, interviews, and statistical analyses of building violations, complaints, and housing market data.  I find that inspectors try to protect and discipline unlikely suspects: they go easy on low- and moderate-income homeowners, go after professional landlords, understand building conditions through a lens of effort and negligence rather than disorder, and often misalign with City priorities.  I also show that inspectors’ decisions backfire; going after landlords increases rents for tenants and going easy on homeowners lowers their property values.  As such, my dissertation challenges conventional wisdom about the coherence of the growth machine and perceptions of disorder, and sheds light on how state actors unwittingly perpetuate inequality.  Overall, I urge sociologists to attend to the potential and parameters of intermediary social locations and the processual nature of the perpetuation of inequality to understand how cities work and how change might occur.']",1/1/2018,Sociology,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_590182\Bartram_northwestern_0163D_14204.pdf,,,,,,,

The two-dimensional conducting interface in the (001) LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ system is the most studied example of oxide interfaces, showing a wide range of coexisting and competing phenomena such as superconductivity, superconductor-insulator transitions, magnetism, and spin-orbit interactions. The (111) oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ system has been recently found to have a few surprises of its own, with intriguing anisotropies in many transport properties along different in-plane crystal directions. This thesis presents the first results on a different SrTiO$_3$ based system: the conducting interface between (La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$) and (111) oriented SrTiO$_3$, which has a smaller strain as compared to the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ system. Electrical transport measurements at cryogenic temperatures reveal that no systematic anisotropy is seen in transport properties, unlike in the case of (111) oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$. High-field magnetotransport shows the presence of high-mobility carriers at high electron densities, and exhibits multiband behavior, tunable \\textit{in situ} using an electrical back-gate, similar to the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ system. The data allow us to draw specific conclusions about band ordering in the system, and point to possible differences between the band ordering in (111) (La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ and (001) as well as (111) oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$. Low-field magnetotransport reveals that a strong spin-orbit interaction emerges in the regime of low electron density, when the high-mobility carriers are depleted from the system, a trend which is opposite to that observed in (001) oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$. The most striking feature is that at millikelvin temperatures, in the regime of low electron densities, concomitant with the development of strong spin-orbit interaction, magnetic order emerges.']",1/1/2018,Physics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_590553\Bal_northwestern_0163D_14207.pdf,,,,,,,

Emotions are fleeting experiential states and, seen through this lens, finding someone more attractive if they share one’s emotions makes as little sense as finding someone especially appealing if they have an upset stomach at the same time you do. The current work explores the possibility that shared emotions serve as cues to similarity on other important dimensions, including shared cognitive appraisals (which may suggest a shared worldview) and shared action tendencies (which may suggest a greater possibility of effective coordination with the other). First, we replicate prior work indicating that people prefer others who share their emotional reactions to upsetting events. Next, we examine whether people infer similarity in cognition and action from similarity in subjective emotion, and whether people continue show a preference for emotional similarity once they have direct information about the other’s cognitive judgments of a situation or about the other’s desired behavioral reactions to the situation. Finally, we assess whether shared subjective emotions, shared appraisals and shared action tendencies each have unique links to distinct types of outcomes: trust and affiliation, satisfaction of the motive for coherence and effectance, and anticipation of effective behavioral coordination.

Therefore, the present work sought to expand upon previous findings by assessing neuroanatomical differences in regions supporting verbal working memory between schizophrenia subjects with high and low levels of functioning.  Methods: This study utilized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate differences in cortical and subcortical grey matter in a sample of healthy controls (CON, n= 45), high functioning schizophrenia subjects (HF-SCZ, n= 23), and low functioning schizophrenia subjects (LF-SCZ, n= 18).

Regions included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, caudate nucleus, pallidum, hippocampus, and thalamus. FreeSurfer was utilized to derive measures of cortical thickness. FreeeSurfer-initialized large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping was employed to characterized subcortical surface anatomy. Statistical modeling included Mixed-effects Analysis to assess between group differences in cortical and subcortical anatomy.

Results: There were no differences in cortical thickness between groups after correcting for multiple comparisons. There were significant between group differences in subcortical surface anatomy across all structures. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that HF-SCZ and LF-SCZ differed in the hippocampus. Correlation analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between hippocampal shape and verbal working memory performance.

Some unique features of online retailing in emerging markets include the prominent use of dynamic pricing and the payment method of cash-on-delivery. My research during PhD study centered around empirical analysis of the online retail industry in emerging markets.', 'In Chapter 1, we investigate how dynamic pricing can lead to higher operational costs through more product returns in the online retail industry.  Using detailed sales data of more than two million transactions from the Indian online retail market, where deep discounts are very common, we document two types of strategic customer behavior that have not been considered by previous research. First, customers who keep monitoring the price after purchase may initiate \\textit{opportunistic returns} because of price drops. Second, customers who anticipate a future return may \\textit{strategically choose a payment method} with a lower return cost. Our logistic regression model indicates that: (1) realized post-purchase price drops lead to higher probability of returns; (2) anticipated price drops after purchase lead to higher probability of using cash-on-delivery, a payment method with a lower return cost. Our findings are robust to alternative model specifications and sample selection procedures. In conclusion, we demonstrate that an optimal pricing policy should take into consideration the potential operational costs of two types of strategic customer behavior, opportunistic returns and strategic choice of payment method.', 'In Chapter 2, we study the Indian banknote demonetization in 2016, which was one of the most significant international events in that year.

The cash shortage induced by the demonetization greatly impacted the online retail industry through two channels, both related to payment choices. First, the demonetization converted a portion of consumers to online payments such as credit cards instead of traditional cash-on-delivery (COD) payments. Second, the demonetization resulted in a reduction of illicit cash in the economy, and hence led to changes of purchase patterns for cash orders. We use detailed sales data of more than three million transactions from a leading Indian online retailer to investigate empirically the effects of the demonetization on the online retail industry. We are able to show that the demonetization has significant impacts in the four following operational metrics in the online retail industry: (1) less cash usage, (2) smaller basket size for cash orders, (3) baskets with less expensive products for cash orders, and (4) more product returns for cash orders.']",1/1/2018,Operations Management,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_591570\Xu_northwestern_0163D_14214.pdf,,,,,,,

With a hybrid method assembled from translation studies, lexicographical history, theater and performance studies, and media studies (including bibliography, book history, and digital humanities), this dissertation proposes a fresh, transnational approach to English Renaissance drama in a way that revises deeply engrained patterns of nationally focused interpretation. Tracing a chronological path from 1570 to 1640, I examine five crucial modes of translation in multilingual publications – seduction, instruction, religious transcendence, exchange, and propagation – and analyze their function in works of professional tragedy, published closet drama, and outdoor and indoor city comedy.  In my readings of these dramatic works, I use bibliographical, literary, and computational evidence to show how Renaissance playwrights in England were not pure examples of a national style, but cosmopolitan authors living and writing in a world of mingled languages and literatures. To borrow the title of John Florio’s bilingual dictionary published in 1598, this was a “world of words” stretching beyond England and branching into foreign political and linguistic territories.', 'Bringing together plays and linguistic publications with a bibliographical approach attentive to handwritten evidence, typographic styles, and the binding-together of books as sammelbände, I show how foreign languages shaped the production and reception of drama in Renaissance England. This is clear, for example, from a 1562 Italian-English dictionary annotated by the translator and playwright Mary Sidney Herbert, or from sixteenth-century sammelbände owned by the prolific reader Gabriel Harvey, which join dramatic publications with grammars and dictionaries. Evidence from these artifacts challenges the traditional, nationally focused ways we think of language and literature in the Renaissance. Additionally, using the text analysis software DocuScope, I complement this bibliographical and literary analysis with an investigation of the linguistic overlap of plays and language-learning dialogues, both at a broad view (i.e., “distant reading”) and at the level of the sentence. In exploring a range of plays dealing with and in foreign vernaculars – some well-known, like Shakespeare’s Merry Wives of Windsor and Kyd’s Spanish Tragedy, and others less familiar, such as Sidney Herbert’s Tragedy of Antony and William Haughton’s Englishmen for my Money – this dissertation analyzes how Renaissance dramatists “translated” multiple vernaculars from printed books into plays, and how these plays continued to speak in French, Italian, Spanish, and other languages to playgoers and readers throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in England.']",1/1/2018,English,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_591768\Keener_northwestern_0163D_14217.pdf,,,,,,,

Discontinuities in the funding decisions of the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) allow me to study the effect of public funding in a large sample of Austrian firms. My estimates suggest that a government research grant increases the propensity to file a patent application with the European Patent Office within 4 years by around 10 percentage points. Stronger effects appear for established firms of advanced age. I present evidence that established firms undertake ambitious research projects when they receive grants. Finally, I interpret the findings in an ""exploration vs. exploitation"" model in which the government agency addresses inefficiency in the direction of research.', 'In the the second chapter, I study the relationship between personal income tax rates and the residential location choice of inventors in Switzerland. Exploiting sharp differences in tax rates for top-income earners across state borders, I find an elasticity of the number of inventors in a municipality with respect to the net-of-tax rate (after-tax income) of around 4.6. This estimate is considerably higher than the elasticities found in previous studies of inventor mobility. Tax policies at the local level, where inventors may lower their tax burden by relocating over short distances, may have particularly strong effects. In addition, I study how location choices depend on other non-pecuniary local amenities. Finally, I document that inventors who have a longer commute are more likely to transfer to a workplace closer to their residence over time. Hence, using income tax policies to draw the residence of inventors closer may have positive spillover effects.', 'The third chapter studies the allocation of R&D subsidies under different modes of trade integration. Two governments pay subsidies to domestic firms that are either technology leaders or technology followers. The model predicts that trade integration leads to increases in aggregate research spending and the share of business R&D funded by government. While subsidies are directed at technology leader firms when markets are separated, trade integration leads to a more even distribution of subsidies that benefits technology follower firms.

The government insures and redistributes resources across individuals who privately observe persistent shocks to their productivity. In this environment, the optimal labor tax is hump-shaped in age, unlike in existing models with no endogenous retirement choice, in which the optimal tax is everywhere increasing. Because of the retirement margin, the total Frisch elasticity of labor supply increases with age. This elasticity effect flattens the labor tax for old workers relative to the model without an extensive margin. In addition, as high-productivity workers retire later than low-productivity workers, the distribution of productivity in the labor force features, over time, a higher mean and lower variance than in the general population. This novel composition effect pushes for a labor tax that declines for old workers. Optimal policy balances these effects with the insurance benefits of taxation, yielding the hump shape in tax rates.

In the baseline economy, the tax and Social Security system are as in the US, agents consume, work and save in a risk-free asset and choose when to retire. The quantitative analysis shows that reforming the tax code has a non-negligible positive effect on the welfare of the citizens but these welfare gains are half of their maximum potential when the reform is conducted by modifying taxes without modifying also the Social Security system because the current SS system is far from optimal and doesn't have incentives for people to delay retirement after age 65."", 'Chapter 3 extends the framework developed in Chapter 1 along three dimensions. The hump-shaped profile of optimal labor income taxes generalizes to the case of workers who have non-separable utility in consumption and leisure.

Finally, with a fixed cost of staying in the labor market that depends on productivity, the results generalize unless If high-productivity workers experience fixed costs of staying in the labor market much higher than low-productivity workers in which case the composition effect pushes for increasing labor income taxes for old workers.']",1/1/2018,Economics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_591882 - DONE\Ndiaye_northwestern_0163D_14220.pdf,,,,,,,

Through the comparative study of asylum claims by sexual minorities and risk evaluations of sex offenders—two settings where courts must adjudicate individuals’ sexualities—my dissertation argues that legal institutions come to know sexuality in culturally contoured and organizationally specific ways that determine access to the rights of citizenship. Sociologists have considered the consequences of classification and measurement extensively and have also studied ways by which the state regulates sexuality. Yet we have not examined the ways that state institutions engage in classification and measurement practices when regulating sexuality and what consequences those practices have. In the legal situations analyzed in this dissertation, I demonstrate how state attempts to objectively measure the subjective and multivalent phenomenon of sexuality depend on non-state expert actors and lead to the constitution of sexual subjects as either acceptable or unacceptable sexual citizens.', 'Drawing on over 400 legal decisions and other documentary materials, 40 semi-structured interviews with legal and scientific actors, and hundreds of hours of multi-sited ethnographic observation, I offer a fine-grained analysis of how expert evaluative practices become institutionalized in legal settings and result in divergent understandings of sexuality within the law. In the case of sex offenders, forensic psychologists offer largely essentialist explanations of sexual deviance drawn from technologies meant to read the body, such as polygraphs and penile plethysmographs. By contrast, asylum advocates put forward more constructionist accounts of sexuality that are sensitive to sexuality’s social determinants. ', 'The juxtaposition of these cases is illuminating because of the rapid shifts in cultural conceptions of both homosexuality and sexual assault that occurred during roughly the same period beginning in the 1970s. “Ruling Sexuality” unpacks the institutional processes undergirding these changes in social understandings of sexuality, showing that these cultural shifts are anchored by institutional practices and highlighting the ways by which legal and scientific organizations and networks refract cultural currents to either create social change or reinforce hegemonic structures.', '\t', 'Part 1 analyzes how competing networks of expertise formed in the domains of sex offender and LGBTQ asylum law and articulated with already existing legal infrastructures to form unique ways of knowing sexuality in each area, what I call “epistemic logics.” These ways of knowing sexuality were not, however, inevitable developments. My dissertation shows that the processes of establishing expertise regarding sexuality required considerable political work. Part 2 considers how epistemic logics affect what counts as empirical evidence of sexuality in legal proceedings and demonstrates how competing social scientific views of sexuality result in different forms of evidence predominating in each legal arena and ultimately result in divergent interpretations of sexuality. Finally, Part 3 shows that approaches to risk assessment (part of both asylum and sex offender hearings) reinforce particular ways of understanding sexuality and that sexual subjects in these arenas are constituted vis-à-vis their relationship to risk. In sum, “Ruling Sexuality” shows that how we know sexuality determines how we govern it. Understanding the knowledge practices employed by the state allows us to better comprehend the functioning of state power, including how it structures norms of citizenship and creates exclusionary boundaries based on sexuality, gender, and other social categories, and importantly, to recognize that “the state” is not uniform but that these processes vary across the many institutions of the state.']",1/1/2018,Sociology,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_591921\Vogler_northwestern_0163D_14222.pdf,,,,,,,

SNAs exhibit properties that are distinct from those of their linear counterparts. These constructs can readily enter cells, evade nuclease degradation, and bind complementary DNA targets with binding constants orders of magnitude larger than those of linear DNA of the same sequence. These fundamentally interesting properties have led to the use of SNAs as medical diagnostic probes, gene regulation agents, and building blocks for programmable colloidal crystal engineering. The unifying property that enables the application of SNAs in all of these fields is their ability to bind complementary DNA sequences with a higher affinity constant than linear DNA. Despite how essential this binding property is to the practical implementation of SNAs, little is known about its origin and how it changes with the SNA architecture, e.g. nanoparticle shape and DNA surface density. ', 'This thesis answers fundamental questions about how the architecture of DNA-nanoparticle conjugates affects their ability to bind complementary DNA, and what considerations should be taken in order to move beyond the spherical architecture of SNAs in order to use optically interesting anisotropic cores. In Chapter 2, the difference between linear DNA hybridization and hybridization to a DNA-functionalized spherical nanoparticle was explored. Hybridization onto DNA-functionalized particles is shown to be enthalpically enhanced due to the structural confinement of the DNA duplex on the surface. This confinement prevents DNA from adopting conformationally unfavorable states, and is further enhanced by high DNA surface density. This understanding challenges the idea that molecular crowding is detrimental to duplex formation, and led us to investigate the effect of DNA surface density and nanoparticle radius of curvature on the types of DNA displacement reactions that govern the efficacy of SNA-based intracellular detection probes. The work in Chapter 3 shows that when a complementary DNA strand is tightly bound to a densely functionalized spherical particle, the propensity for displacement is highly tunable with nanoparticle size. The size of the spherical nanoparticle was varied to demonstrate that complementary DNA strands are more weakly bound on large nanoparticles and displacement is therefore more favorable. The enthalpy of hybridization can be varied by 10-20 kcal/mol simply by changing the SNA architecture (e.g., particle size and DNA surface density) without ever modifying the DNA sequence. This result emphasizes the idea that moving to anisotropic nanoparticle cores, which are larger and have a smaller radius of curvature than spherical nanoparticles, imparts DNA-nanoparticle conjugates with a knob of binding tunability that is independent of the DNA shell. Finally, one limitation to the implementation of anisotropic DNA-functionalized cores is the ability to synthesize certain anisotropic nanoparticles uniformly and in high yields. In Chapter 4, the mechanism of formation of anisotropic gold triangular prisms was studied to understand why reaction conditions favor a broad product distribution. Nanoparticle probes of varying chemical and structural compositions were used to test the hypothesis that prisms form by heterogeneous nucleation. Interestingly, triangular prisms form by homogenous nucleation, in stark contrast to the accepted heterogeneous nucleation pathway. This finding creates a route for the optimization of synthesis yields, because it indicates that to improve product yield and uniformity for some anisotropic nanoparticle shapes, efforts should be placed toward studying reaction conditions that promote homogenous nucleation.', 'This work demonstrates that fundamental knowledge of DNA hybridization thermodynamics on SNAs and nanoparticle synthesis specifically addresses limitations to the construction and implementation of anisotropic DNA-nanoparticle conjugates. Chapter 5 summarizes these findings and points to several future directions for this research area.']",1/1/2018,Chemistry,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_592218\Fong_northwestern_0163D_14227.pdf,,,,,,,

Retailers vary in pricing strategy, ranging from low markup (i.e., ``discount''), no frills retailers to high markup retailers that offer extensive service. The choice of strategy affects the firm's risks and opportunities and therefore debt capacity. The high-end strategy, for example, exposes the firm to price wars and freeriding by discount rivals that could drive it into financial distress. The cross-section of firms  shows a negative relationship between markup and leverage, but the direction of causality is unclear.  To establish causality, I exploit changes in the legality of discount pricing strategies to identify their effect on leverage. In various U.S. states and years, manufacturers could use resale price maintenance (RPM) to set the minimum price a retailer can charge. I find that allowing RPM leads discount retailers to reduce leverage and other retailers to increase it. The results show that firms choose a financial structure closely tied to their product market strategy."", 'Chapter 2: Changing Tax Incentives and Expected Leverage Reduction ', ""This paper studies market expectations about firms' leverage responses to a large change in tax incentives. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), passed in December 2017, both lowered the corporate tax rate and limited the amount of interest that can be deducted for tax purposes. Therefore, it significantly reduced the tax incentives to carry leverage in the firm's capital structure. In an efficient market, the updated valuations of firms previously relying on a tax shield should reflect the lost tax shield value. Moreover, the valuation update should reflect market expectations about the firm's capital structure response to the change in incentives. For example, a static trade-off model would predict that a firm will re-optimize its capital structure by reducing leverage. However, there are potential frictions, such as the leverage ratchet effect. Examining firm returns around the passage of the TCJA, I find that firms with higher leverage did indeed have lower returns. Furthermore, the magnitudes of those losses relative to less levered peers are consistent with expected future leverage reduction. That is, market participants updated valuations as if they expect firms to reduce leverage in response to the reduced tax incentives."", ""Chapter 3: Industry Volatility and Workers' Demand for Collective Bargaining"", ""This paper examines how industry volatility affects a worker's decision to unionize. When deciding whether to vote for unionization, workers weigh the potential gain from higher wages with the risks of reduced employment. Using a database of thousands of unionization elections, I exploit the approximately two-month waiting period between when workers petition the National Labor Relations Board to hold an election and when the actual vote occurs. I find that higher industry equity volatility during the waiting period is associated with fewer votes in favor of unionization. Unemployment insurance, which mitigates workers' costs of job loss, dampens the response to industry volatility. Volatility heightens workers' concerns about job loss as it shifts the risk-return tradeoff for pivotal voters away from unionization.""]",1/1/2018,Finance,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_592234\Clayton_northwestern_0163D_14228.pdf,,,,,,,

In the presence of transaction costs in permit trading, investment patterns may depart from the first best outcome. Storable emissions permits allow firms to smooth costs over time, and abatement investment introduces dynamic incentives into compliance decisions. I apply the framework to study the first nine years (1995-2003) of the US Acid Rain Program. Using data on permit transactions and electricity production, I estimate the model and show that variable transaction costs are substantial. I use the estimated model to quantify the effect of a cap-and-trade program in comparison to a uniform standard, given a fixed level of aggregate emissions. I find that the total costs of reducing emissions under cap-and-trade are 16.6% lower. Although health and environmental damages from \\mathrm{SO_{2}} emissions increase due to the change in the geographic distribution of emissions, the net benefit of the cap-and-trade is positive.

Microstructures support mechanical strength, stability, and flexibility, while nanostructures realize main functionalities such as superhydrophobicity/-philicity, structural color, and selective filtration. Most of multiscale systems for desired applications are consisting of surface patterns and underlying substrates with different materials. Because discontinuous and delaminated interfaces hinder system robustness, tailoring the adhesion between the hierarchical structures and the substrates is an another design factor to be considered. Monolithic integration of 3D patterns into flexible and soft materials is ideal to preserve the structural functionalities under dynamic conditions such as substrate bending or stretching.', 'Most efforts to fabricate hierarchical patterns with length scales spanning several orders of magnitude (e.g., nm to μm) have relied on complex top-down processes such as multistep photolithography or imprinting.

For example, the queue lengths at different time points and the waiting times of different items (jobs, customers) in queue are strongly dependent. To reduce dependence-related complexities, it is customary to assume that the system primitives (such as the arrival processes, service times, patience of different customers, etc.) are independent from one another as well as from the systems dynamics and state. However, in many settings, dependencies across different primitive processes, or between a primitive process and the state of the system, should clearly hold. For example, it stands to reason, and has been shown empirically in call centers, hospitals and restaurants, that the service requirement of a customer may depend on that customer's patience or on the time that customer spends waiting in queue. A natural question to ask is then: To what extent do these types of dependencies impact the performance, control and optimal design of a service system? In this thesis, I aim to answer this question for fundamental queueing models."", ""I start by considering two relevant dependence structures in large service systems: In the first, customers' patience depends on their individual service requirement; in the second, the service requirement of each customer depends on that customer's delay in queue. Since either dependence structure renders exact analysis intractable, I employ a fluid approach to approximate the mean-field behavior of the stochastic queueing systems, which illustrates a first-order impact of both dependencies on the system's performance. Using a stationary analysis, I demonstrate a fundamental difference between the two dependencies in their stationary behavior for the corresponding fluid models. Despite this difference, surprisingly, a unified model can be developed to describe the two dependencies simultaneously, which is further used to characterize the relation between the two dependencies using the concept of equivalence class. Such relation yields important insights to the empirical identification of the dependence, which is otherwise very difficult given that any dataset of service systems is censored due to customer abandonment."", ""To manifest the role of pricing in efficiently exploiting the underlying system structure, I consider another type of dependence in service systems in which a customer's value for service depends on that customer's service requirement. In a queueing-game framework, I analyze the impact of such dependence on the service provider's revenue performance. I show that a positive dependence between the service value and the service requirement may hurt the provider's revenue if customers are charged the same price. In response to the positive dependence, I propose a novel service-based pricing scheme which prices a customer's service based on that customer's realized service time. I demonstrate that the positive dependence could be exploited under service-based pricing to generate more revenue compared to the case of no dependence.""]",1/1/2018,Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_594449\Wu_northwestern_0163D_14235.pdf,,,,,,,

Using MD-CS, scientific contributions ranging from increased understanding of energy transfer in photosynthetic biological proteins to correlating the motion of electrons in semiconductors have been achieved. Concurrent with these (and many other) discoveries, the development of increased experimental sophistication and instrumental sensitivity allowed for information about these processes to be derived more rapidly and comprehensively, with the following goal always in mind: that no level of physical or dynamical understanding be obscured or ambiguous due to limitations of the apparatus. However, despite the tremendous gains in chemical knowledge and technical expertise, third-order MD-CS still suffers from spectral congestion and uncertain spectral assignment, especially as it concerns the convolution of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. The first part of this thesis is centered around the development and implementation of a novel fifth-order MD-CS technique, known as Gradient-Assisted Multi-dimensional Electronic-Raman Spectroscopy (GAMERS), designed specifically to address and alleviate the aforementioned problems. Due to the careful temporal ordering of resonant and non-resonant excitation pulses, this technique allows for vibrational coherences on the ground-state to be isolated from that of the excited-states. The viability of GAMERS is demonstrated on two laser dyes, IR-895 and IR-140.', 'In general, the more dimensions introduced into a MD-CS technique, the better the spectral resolution and discrimination, lending towards increased information being derived about the system under study. However, the price paid for increased dimensionality is exponentially increased data acquisition times, placing stress on apparatus stability and sample integrity, which, ultimately, inhibits practical implementation of higher order MD-CS techniques. The second part of this thesis deals with a methodological advancement of GAMERS, where non-uniform sampling based on the projection-slice theorem and the inverse Radon transform significantly increases the speed of signal acquisition. In addition, we demonstrate that this method, denoted PROjection-reconstruction GAMERS (PRO-GAMERS), as compared with uniform sampling, has superior sensitivity and does not significantly sacrifice frequency resolution. These advantages are a consequence of our non-uniform sampling method in general, and would apply to any high dimensionality MD-CS technique. We demonstrate the utility of PRO-GAMERS on Nile Blue A perchlorate.', 'Quantum Dots (QDs) have shown promise for a range of practical applications, due to the wide synthetic tunability of their absorption and emission spectra. Despite an array of synthetic and spectroscopic studies, a full understanding of the underlying electronic structure has been difficult to realize. To achieve this, it is not only necessary to separate homogeneous peak shapes from heterogeneous ones, but to also separate overlapping homogeneous features from each other, a feat that has only been realized under certain experimental conditions. In the last part of this thesis, we use GAMERS to study colloidal CdSe QDs at room temperature in solution, separating the signal across two dimensions involving excitonic transitions and one involving phonon energies. In effect, we not only demonstrate the ability of GAMERS to resolve the congested spectral peak shapes to the extent aforementioned, thereby approaching the single-particle linewidth, but we also collect statistics regarding the ensembles present within the sample, all done under sample conditions representative of those wherein QDs are applied practically (i.e., room temperature). This opens a space for novel scientific inquiries, as GAMERS unlocks the ability to grasp single-particle electronic structure for a wide variety of complex systems where room temperature dynamics are most relevant.']",1/1/2018,Chemistry,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_594576\Hutson_northwestern_0163D_14236.pdf,,,,,,,

The structural versatility of amphiphile self- assembly also provides a unique platform for the design of functional soft materials with controllable structural features. However, little is known about the correlation between external stimuli, intermolecular forces and the self-assembly structure, which is extremely significant for understanding the transformation of assembly structures in biological processes as well as the materials design. Intermolecular electrostatic interaction is one of the dominant forces for driving the self-assembly process. In this dissertation, different self-assembly system will be investigated and I will present how electrostatic interaction affects the self-assembly structures and properties. I will first demonstrate a modular series of C16Kn peptide amphiphiles where intermolecular electrostatic interaction and steric repulsion can be controlled by solution pH and size of the ionizble headgroup. A large diversity of self-assembly structures, ranging from spherical micelle to bilayer nanotube, can be observed through subtle changes in the electrostatic and steric repulsions. Moreover, C16K1 peptide bilayer membrane exhibits a structural transformation from planar bilayer ribbon to rolled-up cochleate structure when increasing the ionic strength, and the interlayer spacing in the cochleate structure is directly related to the solution Debye length. Theoretical studies on each step of the morphological transition successfully correlate the electrostatic interaction with the equilibrium structures of the membrane. Other than peptide amphiphile, thermodynamic phase behaviors of phospholipid bilayer membranes consisting of 3 binary lipid molecules are also studied. The gel-to-fluid phase transition temperatures of lipid bilayers with DMTAP (+1)/DMPC (0) and DMTAP (+1)/DMPS (-1) binary mixtures are measured to explore the contribution of intermolecular electrostatic attraction to stabilizing the gel-phase lipid bilayer membrane. In addition, 2-D lattices of lipid bilayers show “universal” thermal expansion behavior for all lipid binary mixtures, and the intermolecular spacing is also minimized as the intermolecular electrostatic attraction increases.']",1/1/2018,Materials Science and Engineering,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_594671\Gao_northwestern_0163D_14237.pdf,,,,,,,

It specifically covers two main topics: the electrochemical performance of porous two-phase composite cathodes, and the degradation mechanisms of porous single-phase mixed conducting cathodes. Current-voltage measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used extensively to evaluate the cell performance. The impact of microstructure on electrode resistance was studied by using focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), utilizing both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) images. To investigate the mechanisms of electrode degradation during long-term operation, FIB-SEM 3D tomography was used to analyze the microstructural evolution, and a novel selective chemical etching method was developed to examine the surface compositional changes.', '\tDensification of Y0.16Zr0.92O2-δ (YSZ) electrolyte at a reduced temperature, 1250 °C, was achieved by utilizing Fe2O3 as sintering aid, allowing single-step co-firing fabrication of anode- and cathode-supported SOFCs consisting of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.98MnO3-δ (LSM)-YSZ cathodes, YSZ electrolytes, and Ni-YSZ anodes. The resultant LSM-YSZ cathode had higher polarization resistance than a cathode that was fired separately at an optimized temperature of 1175 °C. Analysis of FIB-SEM images showed that co-firing caused more sintering and coarsening than in the optimally-fired LSM-YSZ, reducing triple phase boundary (TPB) density. It was found that reducing the firing time slightly decreased cathode polarization resistance and increased cell power output. To compensate for the over-sintering of LSM-YSZ during co-firing, (Sm0.5Sr0.5)CoO3 (SSC) was infiltrated into LSM-YSZ cathodes in the cathode-supported SOFCs in order to enhance the TPB density. However, coarsening of the nano-scale SSC was observed during the preliminary life tests, leading to significant cell degradation. On the other hand, cathode-supported SOFCs allowed the use of thinner anodes, and hence exhibited high fuel utilization as well as high steam utilization when operating under electrolysis mode.', '\tThe study of degradation mechanisms was conducted on single-phase mixed conducting electrodes, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF). Temperature-induced degradation was investigated on both LSCF symmetric-electrode cells and microtubular full cells consisting of LSCF cathodes. It was found by FIB-SEM 3D tomography that particle coarsening only occurred at sufficiently high temperatures, \uf0b3 950 °C. The performance degradation observed at temperatures < 950 °C was attributed to Sr segregation to particle surfaces, which inhibited the oxygen surface exchange process. A selective chemical etching method with inductively couple plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) detection was developed to quantitatively analyze the Sr surface segregation on the porous LSCF electrodes. This method was also found to be applicable to systems other than LSCF, such as quantifying Ba surface segregation in La0.5-XPrxBa0.5CoO3-δ (LPBC) cathodes. Additionally, degradation during reversing current operation was examined on LSCF symmetric-electrode cells. Results showed that the primary source of the degradation was also associated with Sr surface segregation, with a smaller contribution from current-induced coarsening.']",1/1/2018,Materials Science and Engineering,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_594999\Wang_northwestern_0163D_14240.pdf,,,,,,,

Here we show that the gene-specific heterogeneity of transcript degradation pattern across samples presents a common and major source of unwanted variation, and it may substantially bias the results in gene expression analysis. Most existing normalization approaches focused on global adjustment of systematic bias are ineffective to correct for this bias. We propose a novel method based on nonnegative matrix factorization with over-approximation constraints that allows quantification of RNA degradation of each gene within each sample. The estimated degradation index scores are used to build a pipeline named DegNorm (stands for degradation normalization) to adjust read count for RNA degradation heterogeneity on a gene-by-gene basis while simultaneously controlling sequencing depth.

This is the time period that William Bouwsma labeled “the waning of the Renaissance,” when the freedoms that the Renaissance engendered began to create anxiety and expose rifts in a society searching for order in turbulent times. This project draws on the published writings and personal letters of the three thinkers, covering a span of years from roughly 1589 to 1617. ', '\t“Reason of State and the Politics of Botero, Campanella, and Sarpi in the Waning of the Renaissance” argues that all three thinkers focused on questions of Church and State, morality in politics, and what was the most dangerous external threat facing Europe at the turn of the seventeenth century. They all grappled with the idea of “reason of state,” or ragion di stato, a system of practical politics that Botero first made famous. Reason of state was essentially a Catholicized version of Machiavelli’s politics, and it became the political norm for most of the seventeenth century due to Botero’s work. All three men sought to rework the art of politics with the understanding that they were in Machiavelli’s shadow. The answers that Botero, Campanella, and Sarpi provided to questions of reason of state ranged from support for Church and State; sole support of a universal Catholic empire; sole support for complete state autonomy in secular affairs; the idea that Catholic morality was or was not possible in politics; and the grave threat of the Ottoman Empire and the threats to Venice from the papacy and Habsburg Spain. ', '         The systems of politics described by Botero, Campanella, and Sarpi were in many ways ultimately defined by what they believed was encroaching from the outside, threatening ruin and chaos. All three thinkers felt that the way forward for Italy, Europe, and Christendom required significant alterations in the political conduct of states. Through debates on particularism – the idea that the world should be structured as a concert of multiple state entities – and universalism – the idea that the world was better off as one universal empire ruled by the Catholic Church – the political thought of three of the most prominent political theorists of the late Renaissance era reveals a deep focus in the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth century on establishing internal control in order to turn outward, defeat an external threat, and enact significant change in the world.']",1/1/2018,History,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_596198\Thomas_northwestern_0163D_14244.pdf,,,,,,,

Biopolymers not only play an essential role in nature, but also have wide applications in various fields of industry due to their biofunctionality, biodegradability, renewability, and sustainability. This dissertation focuses on computational studies of biopolymer systems in two specific fields: gene delivery and nanocomposites.', 'Nanoparticle (NP)-mediated delivery of nucleic acids remains a popular nonviral gene delivery strategy that avoids the potential immunogenic and mutagenic risks associated with viral gene vectors. In spite of its great potential, there exist numerous problems that prevent the clinical usage of nonviral gene delivery systems. Computer simulation can play a crucial role in understanding NP formation as well as the interaction of NP with other materials, and guiding the experimental design of effective gene carriers. All-atom simulations can provide insight into the properties of polymeric gene-delivery carriers by elucidating their interactions and detailed binding patterns with nucleic acids. However, to explore NP formation through complexation of these polymers and nucleic acids and study their behavior at experimentally relevant time and length scales, a reliable coarse-grained model is needed. In Chapter 2, I systematically develop such a model for the complexation of small interfering RNA (siRNA) and copolymers. I compare the predictions of this model with all-atom simulations and demonstrate that it is capable of reproducing detailed binding patterns and dynamics. Since the systematic coarse-grained model accelerates the simulations by one to two orders of magnitude, it will make it possible to quantitatively investigate NP formation involving multiple siRNA molecules and cationic copolymers.', 'Previous research has shown that the shape of NPs formed through complexation of plasmid DNA and copolymers can be tuned, which makes it possible to gain an understanding of their shape-dependent transfection properties.

The Rac1- and RhoA-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) kalirin is critical for spine morphogenesis on cortical pyramidal neurons, and postmortem studies have revealed altered kalirin expression in schizophrenia patients. Here I sought to identify rare missense single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the KALRN gene region that encodes one of its gene product’s catalytic domains, and identified one in a schizophrenia patient and his sibling with major depressive disorder. The D1338N substitution significantly diminished the protein's ability catalyze the activation of Rac1. Contrary to wildtype kalirin-7, kalirin-7-D1338N failed to increase spine size and density. Both subjects carrying the SNV displayed reduced cortical volume in the superior temporal sulcus (STS), a region implicated in schizophrenia. Consistent with this, mice with reduced kalirin expression showed reduced neuropil volume in the rodent homolog of the STS. These data suggest that single amino acid changes in proteins involved in dendritic spine function can have significant effects on the structure and function of the cerebral cortex. Following this investigation, I turned my attention to another missense SNV, kalirin-9-P2255T, which displays a penetrance greatly exceeds that of previously identified schizophrenia-associated SNVs. Overexpression of kalirin-9-P2255T leads to diminished basal dendritic branching and dendritic spine size in cultured primary cortical pyramidal neurons, as compared to wildtype kalirin-9. The P2255T SNV directly affected kalirin-9 protein function, leading to increased RhoA activation, but had no effect on Rac1. Remarkably, consistent with human postmortem findings, I found that kalirin-9-P2255T protein levels were higher than those of wildtype kalirin-9. This increase was due to increased mRNA stability of the kalirin-9-P2255T transcript without changes to protein stability, with this SNV predicted to alter mRNA structure. When analyzed together, increased intrinsic RhoA-GEF catalytic activity combined with increased mRNA expression lead to an even greater net activation of RhoA, a protein known to negatively impact dendrites and spines.  Taken together, my data reveal a novel mechanism for disease-associated SNVs and provide a platform for modeling morphological changes in mental disorders.""]",1/1/2018,Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program (NUIN),Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_597098\RUSSELL_northwestern_0163D_14246.pdf,,,,,,,

Nigeria is one of these countries with a huge burden of ICC incidence and mortality.2  As reported in the Global Burden of Cancer 2013, cervical cancer is ranked the 2nd most common in incidence and mortality among all cancers in Nigeria.3', '\tCervical cancer screening (CCS) is an important health care service intervention known to significantly reduce the incidence and mortality from invasive cervical cancer, particularly in developed countries where organized CCS programs are available. 4-10 However, such organized CCS programs are currently lacking in Nigeria and in most other LMICs. Therefore, the opportunity for such screening intervention likely depends on several factors ranging from systems-level factors such as availability of screening and health systems support to overcome barriers to access services, provider-level factors such as offering screening recommendations, and patient-level factors related to health beliefs and ability to complete a screening intention. Indeed, the literature on cancer screening suggests that screening is a process of care consisting of several steps and interfaces between patients, providers, and health care organizations.11 In this context, screening rates are largely driven by strategies that promote interface across organizational boundaries, recruit patients and promote referrals, facilitate appointment scheduling, and promote continuous patient care and engagement.11 ', '\tCervical cancer screening services in Nigeria has been largely opportunistic, and dependent on either recommendation or referral from a provider or the individual woman’s decision to go for screening if aware of such services.12 In such opportunistic screening setting, we currently do not understand the sociodemographic characteristics associated with cervical cancer screening utilization and outcomes. Our overarching hypothesis was that patient-reported HIV was significantly associated with cervical cancer screening utilization in an opportunistic cervical cancer screening service in Nigeria. The scientific premise for this is evidence that ICC is entirely attributable to the persistent infection of a sexually transmissible virus, the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV),13 and its persistence is facilitated by HIV-mediated cellular immune compromise leading to increased risk of cervical dysplasia and ICC.14-18 ', 'This retrospective analysis utilized the de-identified records of women who received cervical cancer screening services offered in an opportunistic screening program through the “Operation Stop” cervical cancer unit of the Jos University Teaching Hospital, Jos, Nigeria over a 10-year period (2006-2016). We adapted the constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM)19 and the system-model of clinical preventive care20 to understand three interrelated but distinct aims in this dissertation: 1. Understand the association between patient-reported HIV and the likelihood of provider referral for a cervical cancer screening; 2. Understand the association between patient-reported HIV and the age at which women have their first cervical cancer screening; and 3. Understand the predictors of abnormal cervical cytology outcome at the time of first cervical screening, and also to understand the hazard of an abnormal cervical cytology outcome at subsequent follow up pap in women with a prior normal pap cytology.', 'The findings of this dissertation contribute to the knowledge and understanding of health care service factors that could guide implementation of cervical cancer screening and prevention in settings with opportunistic screening services. Specifically, this study provides evidence that women who report being infected with HIV are significantly more likely to receive a provider referral for cervical cancer screening compared to women who are HIV uninfected (aOR=2.35; 95% CI: 1.95, 2.82). This study provide for the first time in Nigeria, evidence that women initiate cervical cancer screening at relatively older age (median age: 37 years; IQR: 30-45 years) compared to the recommended age by screening guidelines in developed countries.21-23 We also found that women who were HIV infected had their first cervical cancer screening at a significantly younger age than HIV uninfected women (the mean age at first screening for HIV infected women was 35.0 ± 7.4 years, compared to 38.2 ± 10.2 years for HIV uninfected (p-value=0.001). We also found a positive correlation between the median age at first cervical cancer screening and the severity of underlying precancerous cervical abnormalities. In other words, women who screened at an older age were more likely to have underlying severe dysplasia than women who screened at a younger age. Patient-reported HIV was not significantly associated with mild (aOR=1.04; 95% CI: 0.80, 1.36) or severe (aOR=1.26; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.92) cervical dysplasia. We found that women with other sociodemographic characteristics, such as age at first cervical cancer screening ≥35 years were significantly more likely to have an underlying mild (aOR=2.56; 95% CI: 2.23, 2.95) or severe (aOR=3.57; 95% CI: 2.74, 4.64) cervical dysplasia. Similarly, women who were ≥35 years had a significant hazard of developing an abnormal cytology outcome at follow up (aHR=1.63; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.41). ', 'Finally, our analysis showed that women who completed 7-12 years (aOR=3.07; 95% CI: 2.69, 3.51) or more (aOR=1.43; 95% CI: 1.27, 1.62) of formal education were significantly more likely to have their first cervical cancer screening before age 35. Women with this educational attainment were also significantly less likely to have an underlying precancerous cervical lesion at first screening compared to women of less formal education (aOR=0.65; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.88, and aOR=0.75; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.98, respectively for 7-12 years and >12 years of completed education). ', 'These findings are important and a clarion call for policy makers and women’s care advocates such as the Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria (SOGON) to develop or adopt guidelines that will facilitate early initiation of cervical cancer screening in Nigeria. The effect of education in women seen in these analyses supports the importance of the society to view and invest in women education as a social and public health intervention in Nigeria.

I define the hymn topic as a broad expressive category of music that is simple, singable, and solemn. This topic derives from styles associated with a set of interrelated genres—congregational songs from different traditions, homophonic passages in Catholic polyphony, revolutionary hymns, and operatic scenes of worship—translated into new contexts, presumably with the intention of conveying solemnity and devotion. ', 'Chapter one provides a brief illustration, based on reception history, of the expressive power and signifying mechanisms of the hymn topic. In chapter two, I review the theoretical basis of the theory of musical topics and explain the emergence of the hymn topic in relation to the culture of domestic devotion and the aesthetics of “noble simplicity and calm grandeur” (Winckelmann 1755). Chapter three examines the characteristics of hymn topic in depth by isolating musical parameters. In so doing, I identify several variants of the topic, such as the “graceful hymn”—chordal music in triple meter reminiscent of sacred dances of operatic priestesses—or “spirited” hymns—infused with the dotted rhythms typical of revolutionary music. Chapter four examines the relationship between the I–V-vi progression and the hymn topic (McKee 2007) through corpus study, and applies the results to offer a hermeneutic reading of Beethoven’s Fidelio. The final chapter provides an overview of compositional procedures involving the hymn topic, including typical tropes (Hatten 1994) and conventionalized expressive paradigms. Case studies from Dussek, Gyrowetz, Haydn, Mozart, and Wranitzky incorporate the hymn topic into music analysis and examine its interactions with other elements of musical structure to produce historically sensitive interpretations.']",1/1/2018,Music,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_597883\SanchezKisielewska_northwestern_0163D_14250.pdf,,,,,,,

Each agent's (e.g., division managers, employees) true ability to carry out projects varies over time based on his expertise and private idiosyncratic compatibility with the specifics of the current project. The principal's (e.g., headquarters, management) ability to credibly provide incentives in order to assign projects efficiently hinges on the degree of specialization across agents. Efficiency - where each project is assigned to the agent best suited for it - is attainable if and only if specialization does not exceed a threshold. If specialization is sufficiently high, communication breaks-down entirely. The derivation of a necessary and sufficient condition for efficiency - over all primitives including discounting - enables constructing a simple class of assignment rules that are efficient whenever any rule is, and deriving the key properties of such rules. These properties shed light on the potential benefits or drawbacks of certain management practices in the absence of monetary incentives. The analysis establishes an equivalence between ex-post equilibria - in which agents' ex-post incentive"", 'constraints are satisfied in each period - and a natural class of equilibria in which delegation is driven by past performance, but does not condition directly on past communication. The analysis also studies optimal project assignment when the principal is unable to discriminate between the agents, and characterizes the cost associated with this inability.', ""The second chapter, written in collaboration with Professor Alessandro Pavan, studies mediated many-to-many matching in markets in which valuations evolve over time as the result of shocks, learning through experimentation, or a preference for variety. The analysis uncovers the key trade-offs that platforms face in the design of their matching protocols. It shows that the dynamics that maximize either the platform's profits or welfare can often be sustained through auctions implementing the matches with the highest bilateral score up to capacity. In equilibrium, bidding is straight-forward and myopic. The analysis also sheds light on the merits of regulating such markets. When match values are positive, profit maximization involves fewer and shorter interactions than welfare maximization. This conclusion need not extend to markets where certain agents dislike certain interactions."", ""The third chapter, written in collaboration with Bela Szabadi, studies efficient resolution of partnership disputes where - in a departure from the partnership dissolution literature (Cramton et al. (1987)) - efficiency need not imply dissolution. The analysis characterizes which disputes can be resolved efficiently. Unless a dispute is sufficiently severe, its efficient resolution is infeasible without external subsidy. Furthermore, a dispute's severity has a non-monotonic effect on the cost of efficient resolution. The analysis has implications for the design of arbitration when partners' decision to enter arbitration is itself endogenous. It is shown that a simple two-stage mechanism where partners first choose whether to initiate arbitration, in which case a second-price auction ensues, achieves efficient resolution whenever it is possible. When efficient resolution is impossible, the analysis characterizes when a profit-oriented arbitrator benefits from being more/less conservative in opting for dissolution.""]",1/1/2018,Economics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_598319\Fershtman_northwestern_0163D_14253.pdf,,,,,,,

Electromagnetic metasurfaces, or 2D metamaterials, operating at optical wavelengths are of particular interest due to ease of integration with current fabrication processes for electronic and optical devices. The fabrication of metasurfaces with nanometer-scale meta-atoms has largely been limited to top-down lithographic processes. However, directed assembly approaches offer an alternative route utilizing colloidal nanoparticles as the meta-atoms, deterministically positioned by a combination of top-down lithography and bottom-up self-assembly. Nanoparticle metasurfaces have the potential for higher performance due to reduced scattering at grain boundaries by utilizing single-crystal nanoparticles. In addition, nanoparticles can be synthesized with complex 3D shapes and compositional engineering (Janus particles, core-shell structures, etc.), providing a large parameter space for metasurface design. Moreover, directed assembly provides the ability to manipulate the short-range forces that drive particle assembly to achieve reconfigurable, stimuli-responsive architectures. In tandem with new patterning and assembly strategies for reconfigurable directed assembly, the development of new tools to analyze the assembly process in situ is critical for constructing a detailed and mechanistic understanding of these systems.', 'While structural tunability has been demonstrated in metamaterials at longer wavelengths, most of these approaches fail at nanometer-length scales due to the increased surface forces and difficulty in addressing the individual meta-atoms. Similarly, self-assembly strategies can produce a range of structures with short- and long-range order, but the degree of architectural control and ability to register these assemblies for device applications is limited. In this work, the top-down lithographic control provided by electron beam lithography (EBL) is combined with a bottom-up assembly strategy using DNA hybridization. DNA-functionalized substrates are modified by grayscale EBL patterning (DNA-EBL) to achieve local control over the surface density of the DNA to modulate interactions with complementary DNA-grafted colloidal gold nanoparticles. By this approach, the thermodynamics and kinetics of nanoparticle binding can be manipulated to achieve nanoparticle configurations that change as a function of temperature. First, the DNA-EBL process is described and characterized, demonstrating patterning of DNA density with high spatial resolution to direct nanoparticle assembly at the single-particle length scale. Second, the DNA-EBL approach is utilized to drive temperature-dependent size-selective nanoparticle assembly from a bimodal suspension of spherical gold nanoparticles. Third, this patterning strategy is extended to drive temperature-dependent ordering, alignment and positioning of both gold nanorods and spherical gold nanoparticles in 2D arrays. Finally, the ability to image these processes in situ is explored by the development of a liquid-cell platform based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology compatible with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and correlative techniques.']",1/1/2018,Materials Science and Engineering,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 04/03/2019",Private,\etdadmin_upload_598348\MYERS_northwestern_0163D_14254.pdf,,,,,,,

I suggest that we experience human events rather as components of an overarching project oriented toward some future goal; more specifically, we experience human events as a series of conditions for that goal. My argument expands on Heidegger’s ontology by identifying the structure of human events; further, it brings out Heidegger’s contribution to Kant’s debate with Hume over the legitimacy of causal reasoning, to ongoing debates in Heidegger’s time about the success of Kant’s arguments, and to contemporary Kant scholarship debating the Second Analogy.']",1/1/2018,Philosophy,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_598408\Lambeth_northwestern_0163D_14255.pdf,,,,,,,

Several observers associate it with a recent history of racial profiling, or conservative policing practices of 1990s aimed at reducing violent crime in urban areas, or much earlier national law enforcement policy that developed in the 1980s to combat war on drugs.  A closer examination reveals deeper roots of stop-and-frisk, exposing its long history as a police practice that suddenly developed into criminal procedure law to limit Fourth Amendment rights and further expand police powers at a critical time in U.S. history.  During the 1960s law enforcement agents lobbied for the new stop-and-frisk law.  This dissertation shows that enforcement of stop-and-frisk law and vigorous challenges to it by Black New Yorkers was a major battle of the 1960s. ', 'Historians, however, have neglected to include northern struggles against unreasonable search and seizures and for greater criminal defendant rights in narratives of the modern Civil Rights Movement.  The Nation of Islam, a radical Black religious group, also stood against unreasonable police stops and searches as well as for expanding criminal justice in local courts. Yet their interventions are largely overlooked and under-analyzed.  Scholars argue law enforcement bureaucrats wanted the law as part of the police professionalization movement. This work expands that research and considers the intersections of Black struggles for civil rights and criminal justice. It also shows the new statute arose as a riposte to liberal federal court decisions and from New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller’s political aspirations, which scholars commonly overlook.  This research corrects these gaps and expands historiographies on policing and imprisonment during the postwar civil rights era.

Furthermore, stop-and-frisk law in New York has contemporary relevance for millions of Americans. Given that today more than one million Black people are warehoused in prisons across the United States, it is, therefore, essential to understand the legacy of the 1960s law enforcement policy, struggles against it in the streets and local courts and its connection to Black incarceration.']",1/1/2018,African-American Studies,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_598546\NASH_northwestern_0163D_14256.pdf,,,,,,,

In this thesis, different segregation mechanisms are studied in steady granular heap flows. Flow kinematics and segregation in transient granular flows are also explored. ', '\t', 'First, this thesis studies segregation of flowing density bidisperse materials. The flow kinematics are extracted from Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations, and a relation between the density segregation velocity and the particle density ratio, the local shear rate, and the local concentration is found. A continuum segregation model is adapted to include the density segregation velocity and the model is capable of quantitatively predicting density segregation in bounded heap flows. Segregation of rod-shaped particles with different lengths is also investigated. DEM simulations of cylindrical rod particles reveal a relation between the segregation velocity and the local shear rate, the local species concentration, and the rod length ratio, similar to the relation for spherical particles. This relation is again incorporated into the continuum segregation model which accurately predicts segregation of rod-shaped particles in bounded heap flows.', 'By modulating the feed rate in size bidisperse bounded heap flows, unsteady flows are generated leading to stratification of small and large particles, which is different from the streamwise segregation formed in steady flows. The stratification pattern formed in the modulated flow can be controlled by modulation parameters and demonstrates better mixing than the streamwise segregation. The stratification mechanism is related to non-uniform deposition during transient heap flows. When the feed rate suddenly changes, a growing (or vanishing) wedge of materials originates on the free surface near the feed zone and propagates downstream, indicating non-uniform deposition or erosion occurring during the transient process. The transient flux and surface height profile can be modeled by a local relationship between the local flux and the local slope angle in combination of a continuity equation. Modulating the feed rate is not the only method to generate unsteady heap flows. By increasing the water content in damp granular materials, a transition from steady to unsteady flow can occur. The unsteady flow is a time-periodic flow with each period consisting of a non-depositing downslope avalanche and an upslope propagating granular jump. The transition occurs when the surface angle of the heap is increased (as a result of increasing cohesion) beyond the neutral angle of deposition. The unsteady flow results in inhomogeneous packing density in the deposited heap. In addition, hopper discharge segregation is studied, which is a transient industrial process which occurs after heap formation (hopper filling). DEM simulations reveal that segregation mainly occurs in a surface layer where particles are transported from the sidewall to the hopper center. The continuum segregation model is applied to modeling the particle concentration distribution in the surface layer and the bulk region using velocity profiles developed based on a kinematic model and DEM observations.']",1/1/2018,Mechanical Engineering,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_598630\Xiao_northwestern_0163D_14257.pdf,,,,,,,

Many nested simulation applications involve estimating the probability density function (pdf) or cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the conditional expectation of some inner-level quantity, conditioned on the outer-level random variables. The purpose of finding the distribution is to quantify the uncertainty in the conditional expectation. Much prior work has considered a na\\""{i}ve estimator that uses the empirical distribution of the sample averages across the inner-level replicates. This results in a biased estimator, because the distribution of the sample averages is over-dispersed relative to the distribution of the conditional expectation when the number of inner-level replicates is finite. Whereas most prior work has focused on allocating the numbers of outer- and inner-level replicates so as to balance the bias/variance trade-off, we develop a bias-corrected pdf estimator that is much more accurate for the distribution of the conditional expectation, so that it can substantially improves the accuracy of the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of the conditional expectation in the context of nested simulation problems.', ""In order to obtain the bias-corrected pdf estimator that is applied to the nested simulation, the thesis first considers a simpler but more general problem of density deconvolution with noisy observations. Density estimation for noisy data via deconvolution is a notoriously difficult problem for typical noise densities like Gaussian. We develop a deconvolution method based on quadratic programming (QP) that can achieve better estimation than kernel deconvolution methods. The QP approach appears to have a more favorable regularization tradeoff between oversmoothing vs. oscillation, especially at the tails of the distribution. An additional advantage is that it is straightforward to incorporate a number of common density constraints such as nonnegativity, integration-to-one, unimodality, tail convexity, tail monotonicity, and support constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating such constraints can substantially improve the density estimation. For selecting the regularization parameter, our method offers a simple yet effective graphical approach, in addition to an automated approach based on Stein's unbiased risk estimation."", 'The thesis also considers the problem to improve the UQ in the realm of Gaussian process (GP) modeling for computer/engineering simulations. GP models have emerged as the standard surrogate models for deterministic computer response surfaces, due in part to their built-in mechanism for providing UQ in the form of prediction intervals (PI) on the response, in addition to the response prediction itself. However, their covariance parameter estimation methods may tend to favor giving good response prediction, at the expense of poor UQ. We develop a post-processing adjustment method that takes a fitted GP model, not only regular stationary GP models but also other non-stationary GP-based models, and its training data, and then empirically adjusts the built-in GP UQ so that it is in better agreement with the actual uncertainty in the response predictions. We demonstrate that this substantially improves the accuracy of the UQ, especially for non-stationary response surfaces that have more complex behavior in some input regions.']",1/1/2018,Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_598931\Yang_northwestern_0163D_14259.pdf,,,,,,,

In this work we elucidate the impact of structural and environmental changes on 2nd order (\uf062), 3rd order (\uf067), 5th order (\uf063(3):\uf063(1)), and magneto-electric (My and Pz) NLO response of TICT chromophores. Chapter 1 reports the synthesis and characterization of a series of high-\uf062 TICT chromophores that utilize a new type of acceptor group and exhibit intermediate bi-aryl torsional angles which were previously inaccessible. Whereas earlier TICT chromophores exhibited poor performance in polar solvents, this series maintains a high \uf062 value in DMF. The use of polar solvents has the added benefit of mitigating aggregate formation, thereby enhancing \uf062 in concentrated solutions. Chapter 2 explores the interactions of the highest performing chromophore of the series, B2TMC-2, with organic salt additives, which lead to large spectroscopic changes and improved \uf062 values. The origin of these effects is determined to be coulombic attraction between the salt and the chromophore acceptor group, which competes with dipole-driven aggregate formation. The increases in \uf062 arise entirely from the disaggregating property of the salt, and we demonstrate that the same interactions in solution persist in host/guest films. In Chapter 3, we explore the impact of hybridizing a stilbene and TICT chromophore on \uf067 and \uf063(3):\uf063(1). The observed two-photon absorption is attributed to the stilbene fragment, while the excess polarizablity is related to the twisted fragment, which causes localization of ground and excited states. The \uf063(3):\uf063(1) response contributes significantly to nonlinear refraction, and highlights the drastic change in NLO response resulting from a subtle structural modification. In Chapter 4, we outline the theoretical underpinnings of the first connections between magneto-electric response and molecular structure, showing that the twist motif can be productively applied to 2-D molecules. The sum of this work provides insight into the impact of bi-aryl twist angle, acceptor group identity, and environmental factors on several NLO effects, and in many cases yields productive guidelines based on deep understanding of specific cause/effect relationships.']",1/1/2018,Chemistry,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2019",Private,\etdadmin_upload_599581\Lou_northwestern_0163D_14260.pdf,,,,,,,

Of the three constituents, lignin is one of the most promising but also least valorized, in part because of its complex structure, but also because of the complex product distribution arising upon deconstruction. In this dissertation, the two types of deconstruction chemistry studied are dilute acid hydrolysis (acidolysis) and fast pyrolysis. A structural model that incorporates four of the major structural characteristics of lignin is presented. In order to understand the chemistry of lignin acidolysis, a microkinetic model of the major ether linkage type in lignin is constructed. A pathways-level description of fast pyrolysis is developed, and this chemical model is coupled with the structural model to simulate the intrinsic kinetics of lignin fast pyrolysis.

Understanding of their surface structures and interface formation during growth however, is an area not given enough attention, especially in a class of materials that relies heavily on interfaces to produce its unique properties. The objective of this dissertation is to present theories and tools for probing and understanding the atomic structure of perovskite materials at the 2-D limit (i.e. surfaces and thin films).

Despite these advances, investigations into 3D printing for recreation of the macro- and microstructural components of the liver are still in their infancy. Tailored biomaterials need to be patterned in biologically inspired geometries to induce tissue formation. Here, I will present several strategies that harness 3D-printed geometry, biomaterial bioactivity, or both, in order to influence liver tissue formation and function in vitro.', 'The creation of uniform and geometrically repetitive tissue scaffolds with 3D-printed gelatin enables control over aggregation of cells and nutrient diffusion. When seeding a human hepatocyte cell line onto scaffolds of different geometries, hepatocyte specific functions (albumin secretion, CYP activity, and bile transport) increases in more interconnected 3D-printed gelatin scaffolds compared to a less tortuous geometry and to 2D controls.

Other biomaterials need to be investigated for their potential in liver tissue engineering.', 'Liver decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) hydrogels have several advantages, primarily tissue-specific bioactivity. I sought to apply liver dECM hydrogels to an understudied aspect of liver tissue engineering: the intrahepatic biliary tree. The finer branches of the biliary tree are structurally and functionally heterogeneous. Here I demonstrate the ability of liver dECM hydrogels to induce the in vitro formation of complex biliary networks using encapsulated mouse biliary epithelial cells (cholangiocytes). This phenomenon is not observed with collagen gels or Matrigel. I also illustrate phenotypic stability as well as preliminary function of cholangiocytes, evident by polarization and transporter activity. To better define the mechanism of duct formation, I utilized three fluorescently labeled, but otherwise identical populations of cholangiocytes.

These findings present liver dECM as a promising biomaterial for intrahepatic bile duct tissue engineering and as a tool to study duct remodeling in vitro.', 'However, dECM hydrogels display poor printability on their own, and necessitate additives or support structures to enable true 3D fabrication.

Hence, the study of the mechanical properties of the constituents and the composites is becoming increasingly popular in both academia and industry.', 'Graphene has been shown to have a comparative advantage over traditional materials as composite reinforcements. There is a rapid rise of interest in harnessing the mechanical properties of graphene and its derivatives, like graphene oxide (GO), at larger length scales and higher material hierarchies, i.e. multi-layer assemblies. Despite the great progress in developing synthesis and characterization methods for these materials, the physical mechanisms governing the mechanical performance of multi-layer graphene (MLG) and GO sheets remain poorly understood. Experimental techniques offer limited insights into atomic-scale deformation processes, while atomistic simulations have proved prohibitively expensive in investigating the large-deformation and failure mechanisms of the multi-layer assemblies. Similar bottlenecks also exist for the characterization of matrix materials, such as epoxy resins. Previous atomistic investigations of epoxy resins fall short in linking nanoscopic observations to macroscopic properties, and thus, it limits the use of simulations in the computational design of new materials.', 'To overcome these critical issues, we first develop coarse-grained (CG) models of MLG and GO sheets, which are incorporated into molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that are capable of quantitatively reproducing their mechanical responses in both elastic and fracture regimes. Additionally, the CG model of GO accurately captures the heterogeneous mechanical properties of GO with different chemistries. With two to three orders of magnitude increase in computational efficiency, CG MD simulations are then used to elucidate the mechanisms of deformation and failure of MLG and GO sheets by collaborating with experimentalists. Specifically, we discover for the first time an atomic-level interlayer slippage process in MLG, which leads to repeatable energy dissipation of MLG sheets under film deflection tests. We also successfully elucidate the experimentally measured thickness-dependent strength of MLG sheets. In addition, differences in the failure modes of GO membranes under nanoindentation are shown to be due to differences in the chemistries of the contact area. We also show the potential of these CG models to study the fracture toughness of mesoscale graphene and GO sheets, as well as to investigate the mechanical properties and failure mechanisms of nacre-inspired nanocomposites. We also utilize our CG MD approach to study the ballistic impact behavior of thin MLG sheets. The simulation results reveal distinctive failure mechanisms that deteriorate the ballistic resistance of MLG sheets. Specifically, we have observed the in-plane cone wave formed upon impact can reflect from clamped boundaries and induce early perforation. In addition, the compressive wave in the thickness direction could result in spalling-like failure, similarly to the failure mechanism in the impact on macroscopic concrete specimen. To relate the observed failure mechanisms to microballistic experiments, we also develop analytical relationships, based on continuum mechanics theories, to bridge the size scales and provide a full picture of the deformation processes.', 'Among all the matrix materials, epoxy resin is promising in graphene-based nanocomposites as well as in carbon fiber reinforced composites with its excellent mechanical properties and temperature resistance. However, developing new and better ones always take a long time as we have limited understanding of the physics underlying their properties. To characterize its structure-property relationship from molecular scale, we first develop a robust atomistic model for its crosslinked structure and investigate the effect of resin functionality, crosslink degree, and component ratio on resin thermomechanical properties. More importantly, we link atomistic tensile simulations of the resin with its macroscopic fracture energy, using a theoretical fracture mechanics model developed for the polymeric system. With this theoretical model, we also provide physical insight into the molecular mechanisms that govern the fracture characteristics of epoxy resins. Then, to establish the structure-property relationship of carbon fiber composites from a multiscale perspective, we utilize MD simulation results and an analytical gradient model to characterize the properties of the interphase region between fiber and matrix, which are then integrated into finite element analysis to investigate the failure behavior of composites. Using this multiscale framework, we explicitly elucidate that the nanoscale interphase region is crucial to capture the realistic mechanical properties of composites, especially the non-linear response at large deformation.', 'The studies presented here illustrate important mesoscale physical mechanisms governing the mechanical performance of composite constituents such as MLG and GO sheets and epoxy resins as well as the entire composites.

Drawing on 19 months of ethnographic research in Tanzania, conducted in Kiswahili from 2013-2017, it ethnographically examines how residents of a biodiversity hotspot in Tanzania creatively and strategically navigated conservation policies and political-economic marginalization. It argues that people most affected by conservation policies—smallholder farmers living on the borders of the protected forest—participated in environmental governance in ways that went beyond the limiting platforms provided by conservation institutions in the name of community-based management.

Chapter 2 introduces a small cadre of residents from the protected area’s villages who have found ways to significantly profit from conservation initiatives through tourism and research. These men engaged in material and semiotic labor to visually manifest the abstract concepts of biodiversity and nature, both through performances as tour guides and through landscaping decisions as new land owners. Chapter 3 extends the linguistic-anthropological and semiotic concept of “uptake” to analyze a myriad of residents’ discursive and material responses to institutional efforts to commodify natural resources in the name of conservation. With uneven levels of success, village residents creatively and strategically incorporated market-based conservation messages into their broader portfolio of economic activities and communicative resources, thereby calling into question the ambiguities and inadequacies of conservation policies.

As an alternative, this dissertation provides a media ecology of the city's Latinx mediascape between the years 1953 and 2012. This dissertation investigates four case studies: (1) Univision's former television affiliate, WCIU; (2) the Little Village/Pilsen neighborhood micro-broadcasting radio stations, WCYC and WRTE; (3) the longest running Latinx film festival in the country, the Chicago Latino Film Festival; and (4) the renowned activist group, the Immigrant Youth Justice League. "", 'Over the course of four chapters, this work outlines the history of Chicago\'s Latinx media industry, revealing four eras hereafter known as the dawn of Latinx broadcasting (1953-1986); the decade of the ""Hispanic"" (1986-1996); the intermedial turn (1996-2006); and the rise of social me-dia (2006-2012). These historical junctures demarcate key moments of change in the city\'s Latinx media industry, each containing specific, distinguishable characteristics. The dawn of Latinx broad-casting (1953-1986) was marked by broadcasters privileging Latin America in their representations of Latinidad, the sense of being Latinx. The decade of the ""Hispanic"" (1986-1996), a term first in-troduced by Maria Elena Toraño in 1979, bore witness to the development of a more unified U.S.-American Latinx viewing public. The intermedial turn (1996-2006) was characterized by an interest in producing work across media platforms. Lastly, the rise of social media (2006-2012) was, in many ways, a continuation of the intermedial turn but differed in that there was a quicker, more pronounced shifting of scales, which demonstrated a clear strategy for developing a sense of com-munity and undocumented identity according to scale. Each scale-shift not only addressed a differ-ent segment of the U.S. undocumented community but also reflected an alternative understanding of citizenship, where the U.S.-American Latinx population was not only made-up of U.S. citizens but also of undocumented Latinxs, who could engage with the nation through Latinx cultural citi-zenship and other forms of deviant citizenship.

This dissertation explores how Latinx media producers represented a sense of Latinidad through such mediated Latinities, offering a more nuanced language for discussing the varied representation of Latinx identity in media. As a media ecology, this work also engages with literature in media convergence and intermedia studies, building on Henry Jenkins' notion of transmediation, a spread of cultural material across media, to argue that mediated Latinities engender a structure of feeling that coheres Chicago's Latinx mediascape through the transmediation of Latinidad.""]",1/1/2018,Screen Cultures,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_603075\Almendarez_northwestern_0163D_14278.pdf,,,,,,,

The dissertation examines these questions through the study of US asylum policy in the post-Cold War period. Using multiple sources of data, including archival policy documents, case law, media sources, interviews and administrative data on asylum decisions, and applying mixed methods (historical/documentary analysis, ethnography and quantitative analysis), it investigates how asylum officials make policy and implement rules when they cannot default to preestablished categories and patterns of classification, why frontline actors operating under time constraints and limited resources decide to devote extra time and resources to cases for which they cannot readily supply known characterization, and to what extent does the ambiguity inherent to classificatory regimes provide structural opportunities for change? This research contributes to existing asylum scholarship by examining two central, albeit largely overlooked, aspects of the asylum determination process: the role of embedded distinctions of worth in the formation of asylum policy during periods of policy upheaval, and the conditions that enable asylum officers to engage in moral deliberation, and to devote time and resources in order to assist applicants whom they perceive as worthy of asylum but whose experiences of harm do not squarely fit within agency standards for determining asylum eligibility. The contributions of this thesis are not limited to asylum. The thesis offers a new conceptual framework for identifying the conditions that lead to shifts in frontline actors’ disposition from rule-bound bureaucrats to moral deliberators, and links institutional and moral dimensions of decision-making to delineate the process through which embedded categories of worth influence implementation of policy when established patterns of practice are suspended, and agents can no longer rely on institutionalized policy scripts.']",1/1/2018,Sociology,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_603425\Shiff_northwestern_0163D_14280.pdf,,,,,,,

However, while there has been much interest in PSA process development, the choice of adsorbent for the separation is just as important as the process configuration. Therefore, it is important to develop PSA processes in conjunction with development of the adsorbent. One class of adsorbents that received significant interest in the past few decades are metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are crystalline, porous materials synthesized through self-assembly of metal nodes and organic linkers. Due to the great variety of organic linker and metal node combinations, thousands of potential MOFs can be synthesized and specifically tailored for any applications including CCS. This work focuses on the simultaneous development of MOFs and PSA processes to better understand and improve the process to reduce the cost of CO2 capture.', '\tFirst, we investigated the impact of water on the performance of different materials in a two-stage Skarstrom cycle. In this investigation, we found that the dehydration method that resulted in the lowest CO2 cost was to feed the wet flue gas directly into the column. This resulted in the first section of the column acting as a desiccant, capturing the water, while the remainder of the bed separated the CO2 from the N2. From this work we also found that the inclusion of water can shift the ranking of the ideal material, as we saw that zeolite 13X was the best performing material under dry conditions, but zeolite 5A performed equally well under wet conditions. Next, we developed a new general evaluation metric from CO2 capture cost data for 190 MOFs using the four step Fractionated-Vacuum Pressure Swing Adsorption (FVPSA) cycle. This metric has a higher Spearman correlation coefficient with the cost data than several other metrics previously proposed, making it useful for future work in quickly evaluating a MOF’s potential for CCS applications. In developing the metric, we discovered that the most important feature of this metric is the working capacity of N2, followed by the working capacity of CO2. We also evaluated 16 MOFs that are reported in the literature to be promising for CCS using a modified Skarstrom cycle to rank them based on economic performance metrics, finding UTSA-16 as the best performer. Finally, we showed that to reduce the computational time for simulating PSA cycles, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a promising surrogate model that are able to simulate PSA steps that may be used in a given cycle.']",1/1/2018,Chemical and Biological Engineering,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_603694\Leperi_northwestern_0163D_14281.pdf,,,,,,,

Platyrrhini, a taxonomic parvorder within Primates, is their formal taxonomic designation, as they represent the sister group of the Catarrhini or all of the Old World monkeys and apes.  These platyrrhine monkeys are diverse in terms of body size, their ecology, and in their movement patterns.  From the smallest anthropoid, Cebuella pygmaea, to the large bodied Brachyteles, platyrrhines inhabit the Amazon rain forest basins, the Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil, and the Central American rain forests.  Their locomotor abilities range from arboreal quadrupedalism, to climbing and leaping preferences, to forelimb suspensory behaviors.  It is the intention of this study to identify anatomical correlates in the hind limb of these New World monkeys relative to their respective movement patterns.', 'Forty-five species of platyrrhines, representing hundreds of individual specimens, were measured and analyzed to determine if morphology of the hip and pelvis, thigh and proximal femur, and/or knee, could be mapped to their known locomotor behavior.  The features examined were chosen on the basis of previous studies conducted on platyrrhine primates or other mammals where hindlimb anatomy had been correlated with positional behavior.  Behavioral studies that included quantified and qualitative descriptions were examined.   Statistical analyses, including regressions and the analysis of variance were employed to determine if correlations between morphology and movements could be specified.  ', 'Results from this study indicated that morphological adaptations for leaping are more generalized within platyrrhines than in “prosimian” primates.  Dorsal ischial projection was found to be a good indicator of (vertical) leaping in pithecids for example, but not among callitrichids nor among platyrrhines as a whole.  There are elements of the platyrrhine postcranium that are linked to climbing including a wide pubis, robust intertrochanteric crest and posteriorly placed lesser trochanter.  The New World brachiators have increased their joint excursion range at the hip and evidence two features of the knee, a wide patellar groove and gracile medial condylar lip, that help to distinguish them morphologically from the other groups.

Callitrichids, in particular (excluding Cebuella, the pygmy marmoset), although exhibiting differences in frequency and style of locomotor behaviors, actually do not vary very much morphologically in their hindlimb anatomy.  While several monkeys, including Cebuella and Ateles species, stand out as being genuinely unique morphologically and do not fit the expectations of the movement hypotheses developed in this study.     In the end, this project has identified features of the hindlimb that are indicative of certain locomotor behaviors, while also illustrating platyrrhine locomotor behavior in terms of a rather generalized hindlimb morphology.']",1/1/2018,Driskill Graduate Training Program in Life Sciences,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_604098\Mutehart_northwestern_0163D_14282.pdf,,,,,,,

The positive effect of phonotactic likelihood is replicated over the whole domain of likely and unlikely forms, and the realistic limitations of simple neighborhood density measures are shown. Post-hoc analysis also suggests that participants perceived apparent morphology in the pseudowords, and gave such items higher wordlikeness ratings.', 'Chapter 4 demonstrates that participants also give gradient typicality judgments for real words, in contrast to the predictions of some traditional and current theories of well-formedness. In this new analysis of data from Bailey and Hahn (2001), significant variation is observed in the judgments of both real words and pseudowords, and this variation correlates with similar factors for both categories.', 'Chapter 5 follows upon the morphological findings in Chapter 2 by eliciting explicit morphological decompositions from participants for complex real words and apparently-complex pseudowords.

The possession of nuclear technology does not always grant legal and political nuclear status—a phenomenon evident not only in the recent debate over Iran’s nuclear program but also in the global diffusion of nuclear materials across ostensibly “non-nuclear” countries. And while scholars and policymakers take the distinction between nuclear and non-nuclear to be politically-consequential, what often goes unnoticed is how this distinction is constituted through technical, legal, and normative contexts. This dissertation theorizes the political constitution of the distinction between nuclear and non-nuclear states. I advance a “practice approach” rather than a definitional one by locating this distinction in technical discussions about centrifuges and enrichment levels, in the legal distinction between “nuclear weapons states” and “non-nuclear weapons states” in the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and in normative disagreements over what it means to be a responsible state. Existing scholarship assumes this distinction to reflect material differences in nuclear technology. In contrast, I argue that material differences acquire meaning through negotiation and contestation. As such, the distinction functions as a political and discursive resource: it provides a language by which states enact their identities and interests. The cases of Israel, India, and Iran represent different approaches to the negotiation of nuclear status but all illuminate the centrality of the distinction in shaping global nuclear politics.', 'I theorize three types of contestation over what it means to be a nuclear state: technical, legal, and normative, each of which constitutes a chapter of my dissertation. Each chapter presents a detailed historical analysis of diplomatic politics and discourse analysis of the use of “nuclear” and “non-nuclear” in technical, legal, and normative contexts. From a technical perspective, ambiguities in the difference between civilian and military nuclear technology result in contestation and manipulation of the material components necessary for nuclear statehood. I examine archival evidence to track how Israel’s diplomatic history with the United States unfolds through manipulation of what makes a nuclear weapon a “weapon.” From a legal perspective, I examine both the history and legal text of the NPT in order to show how it shapes India’s self-understanding in the global nuclear regime and becomes a resource for its continuing dissent to the treaty. Finally, the distinction between nuclear and non-nuclear states is also driven by normative understandings of what it means to be a responsible nuclear state.

', 'One strategy involves taking advantage of the recently changing fuel landscape. The natural gas boom that started in the early 2000’s has rapidly changed the way the United States is using chemical fuels. With a surplus of cheap light alkanes, oil has been utilized less often as precursors to the chemical feedstocks ethylene or propylene. Important targeted reactions, most often involving C¬–H bond activation, have been sought to synthesize these important precursors, or possibly even high energy density alkane carriers, in order to convert the primary component of shale gas, methane, to more high-value products. Another strategy is to develop renewable energy processes in order to make them more economically viable. Solar electricity has become exceedingly more efficient and inexpensive, but an equally difficult problem has emerged in energy storage. The storage of solar energy in the form of chemical bonds offers an intriguing pathway toward solar power utilization at times when direct solar-to-electricity conversion is not possible.

The projects detailed in this thesis attempt to study these energy-related conversions from the perspective of exploring new catalyst supports. A long-standing problem in catalysis sciences is the ambiguity of the structure of the active form of the catalyst species due to non-uniform grafting sites present on conventional heterogeneous supports. However, an emerging class of supports, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), presents hydroxo/aqua ligands that are crystallographically defined such that deposited metal ions are structurally uniform. We take advantage of these benefits to synthesize few-atom clusters of metal oxides/sulfides and study their ability to catalyze these energy-related reactions. First, precursor-development for atomic layer deposition processes is explored for the deposition of cobalt sulfide materials. Then, NiSx clusters deposited in the MOF NU-1000 are used in the photocatalytic conversion of water to hydrogen gas. This approach is extended to other metal sulfide materials to attempt to draw parallels on water reduction activity with the elemental and structural identity of the metal sulfide. Next, cobalt oxide clusters are used to catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

We have demonstrated, both computationally and experimentally, that the physico-chemical regulation of chromatin packing scaling, as measured by PWS, can be used to manipulate transcriptional diversity, intercellular heterogeneity, and gene network heterogeneity. Here we use PWS microscopy and complementary biological assays to show the driving force of chromatin scaling and its regulation in the context of several biological applications including cardiovascular inflammation, stem cell plasticity, and carcinogenesis and chemoevasion.  We show that controlling the physicochemical environment within the cell’s nucleus to alter chromatin scaling can predictably modulate global patterns in gene expression. This whole-transcriptome manipulation based on the control of the physiochemical nanoenvironment of chromatin has implications in these as well as essentially any disease state and may allow for the ability to control the overall behavior of biological systems.']",1/1/2018,Interdepartmental Biological Sciences (IBiS) Graduate Program,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_606133\Wodarcyk_northwestern_0163D_14289.pdf,,,,,,,

In the first chapter, I study how market participants with heterogeneous beliefs and non-commitment can create and manage counterparty risk in a sequentially and bilaterally traded market. I find that the equilibrium price may not always reflect counterparty risk due to risk-management efforts by market participants. Even when there is no default in equilibrium, market participants cannot attain the best allocations since risk-management is costly. In the second chapter, I study disagreements among market participants under more general belief structures. Here, I employ the collateral equilibrium framework to study the how the disagreements can affect equilibrium pricing of assets and derivatives. I provide sufficient conditions for bubble to exist in equilibrium prices. Moreover, I find that certain types of disagreements can also generate volatility smirks in options. In chapter three, I study asynchronized trading among market participants in presence of a growing asset bubble. Market participants disagree on the starting date of an exogenous asset bubble and decide when to exit the market. I also introduce a large market participant alongside numerous infinitesimal market participants to study their interactions and the mechanism of the bursting an asset bubble.

Previous investigation suggests that a region of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) may distinguish SuperAgers from their cognitively average-for-age peers. This project investigates working memory as a potential neuropsychological factor supporting SuperAger’s superior episodic memory because it is a cognitive function associated with the ACC and is hypothesized to play a role in episodic memory. This project hypothesized that SuperAgers would demonstrate better working memory ability than their cognitively average-for-age peers that was equivalent to the performance of average middle-age adults. Further, it was hypothesized that the elevated working memory performance of SuperAgers would be driven by a reduced error rate and an increased ability to detect signal amongst noise (d’). It was also hypothesized that working memory performance would be associated with cortical integrity of the ACC.', 'Methods: Data were prospectively collected from SuperAgers, cognitively average-for-age elderly adults, and cognitively average-for-age middle-age adults at the Northwestern University Cognitive Neurology & Alzheimer’s Disease Center. Participants completed neuropsychological tests including traditional episodic and working memory tasks, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan to obtain structural measures of the ACC, and the experimental measure which was an adapted visuospatial working memory paradigm that enabled the measurement of working memory maintenance components. ANOVAs were used to assess group differences in performance on neuropsychological tests and the experimental working memory paradigm, and measures of cortical brain integrity. For performance on the experimental working memory paradigm, generalized linear models were used to investigate the effects of group and parametrically varied paradigm variables on different components of working memory performance. Partial correlations controlling for estimated premorbid intelligence were used to assess relationships between neuropsychological test performance and working memory performance on the experimental paradigm as well as between measures of cortical brain integrity and performance on both neuropsychological tests and the experimental paradigm. ', 'Results: SuperAgers outperformed their cognitively average-for-age peers on neuropsychological tests of working memory and did not differ from the performance of middle-age adults. While no significant between-group differences were found with regard to overall accuracy or error rates on the experimental working memory paradigm, SuperAgers demonstrated a significantly smaller rate of decline, or perhaps better maintenance of, their ability to detect true signal amongst noise in response to increasing task demands (d’ slope) compared to middle-age adults as well as better maintenance compared to cognitively-average-for-age peers that did not reach statistical significance. Across all participants, rate of change in sensitivity to detect signal from noise (d’ slope) was positively correlated with thickness of the left ACC ROI such that greater thickness was associated with smaller rates of decline in d’ in response to increasing load. ', 'Discussion: Project results demonstrate a brain-behavior relationship between two factors, d’ slope and the left ACC ROI, that uniquely distinguish SuperAgers from Controls of similar age and Controls with similar episodic memory ability. It may be that the ACC’s role in error detection enables SuperAgers to be less vulnerable to distraction in the face of increasing noise.']",1/1/2018,Clinical Psychology,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_606614\Maher_northwestern_0163D_14293.pdf,,,,,,,

Primary cerebellar neurons receive synaptic inputs related to sensory stimuli and motor commands, leading to modulation of their firing. Furthermore, synaptic input differs substantially between cerebellum-dependent behaviors. I have made voltage- and current-clamp recordings from Purkinje and eurydendroid neurons in the larval zebrafish cerebellum while simultaneously recording fictive swimming from the ventral root in the tail to describe the synaptic inputs and spiking activity of these cells while the fish was at rest, during visual sensory stimulation, spontaneous swimming, and sensory-evoked reflexive swimming. For Purkinje cells, I have tested how plasticity manifests in individual neurons during associative motor learning by following synaptic activity and spiking from when the fish is naïve to when it reliably performs learned swimming. I discovered differences in Purkinje cell spiking during learned swimming that reflected different forms of plasticity, were partially predicted by basal synaptic properties, and related to the position of the cell. Using optogenetics to manipulate Purkinje cell activity, I found that Purkinje simple spikes can play a transient, instructive role during learning. For eurydendroid neurons, I found that inhibition from Purkinje complex spikes is similar to that from simple spikes, and that 2-7 Purkinje cells converge onto each cell. Spiking is differentially modulated during cerebellar behaviors. Acute excitation makes spiking more likely during visual stimuli. During swimming, spiking is anticorrelated with inhibitory drive, which is rhythmic during volitional but not reflexive swimming. Overall, my experiments demonstrate differential responses of cerebellar neurons to movements, diversity among neurons in the types of synaptic drive they receive, and multiple forms of plasticity that support different aspects of cerebellar learning. Many of my findings match those from experiments on the cerebellum of mammals, revealing properties of this circuit that are likely conserved across all vertebrates.']",1/1/2018,Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program (NUIN),Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_606791\Harmon_northwestern_0163D_14294.pdf,,,,,,,

An alternative strategy is described where the use of redox-active bridging ligands to generate stabilized organic results in direct exchange magnetic coupling between the ligand radical and metal center.', '\tChapter 2 focuses on the use of chloranilate-radical ligands to synthesize a two-dimensional, porous Fe-based metal-organic framework in two redox states. Heterogenous reduction of this material reveals a magnetic ordering temperature of Tc = 105 K, the first metal-organic magnetic to order above 100 K that is not based on organonitrile ligands. The framework in both the pristine and reduced states is also shown to be electrically conductive. Chapter 3 explores a one-dimensional material composed of FeII centers bridged by diamagnetic, dianionic ligands. However, below 220 K the chain undergoes a spontaneous and reversible electron transfer to form FeIII centers bridged by the trianionic, radical ligand form. The ensuing strong metal-radical magnetic coupling leads to long-range correlation along the chain and the first example of a semiquinoid-bridged single-chain magnet. Finally, Chapter 4 details work to utilize a bridging ligand with exclusively nitrogen donor atoms. A series of dinuclear molecules are synthesized with CrIII, MnII, FeII, and CoII and the radical bridged species generated through in situ or postsynthetic reduction. Comparison of magnetic data across the series reveals very strong metal-radical magnetic coupling in all molecules but also large variation in coupling strength depending on metal identity. These results are rationalized using ligand field and effective nuclear charge arguments. Together, these results demonstrate the versatility of semiquinoid ligands in promoting strong magnetic coupling in two-, one-, and zero-dimensional systems.']",1/1/2018,Chemistry,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_606797\DeGayner_northwestern_0163D_14295.pdf,,,,,,,

For decades, scientists and engineers have turned to biological systems to help meet societal needs in energy, medicine, materials, and more—especially when chemical synthesis is untenable. Often, biologically-produced small molecules are insufficient for production at the optimal titer, rate, or yield because natural sources are difficult to optimize and are simply not scalable (e.g., plants grow slowly). Thus, engineers seek to design enzymatic reaction schemes in microorganisms to meet manufacturing criteria. Unfortunately, this is difficult because design-build-test (DBT) cycles—iterations of re-engineering organisms to test new sets of enzymes—are detrimentally slow due to the constraints of cell growth. As a result, a typical project today might only explore dozens of variants of an enzymatic reaction pathway. This is often insufficient to identify a commercially relevant solution, consequently requiring more DBT iterations. In this dissertation, I establish and develop an in vitro prototyping and rapid optimization of biosynthetic enzymes approach (termed iPROBE) to test biosynthetic pathways in cell-free systems and inform cellular metabolic engineering. In this approach, cell-free cocktails for synthesizing target small molecules are assembled in a mix-and-match fashion from crude cell lysates selectively enriched with pathway enzymes. I demonstrate that this approach can quickly study pathway enzyme ratios, tune individual enzymes in the context of a multi-step pathway, screen enzyme variants for high-performance enzymes, and discover enzyme functionalities. I develop automation techniques including liquid-handling robotics and machine learning to enhance cell-free screening experiments. Furthermore, I study the cell-free physiochemical environment of cell-free biosynthetic pathways to gain control over it, enhancing our ability to engineer pathways in cell-free systems. The rapid ability to build pathways in vitro using iPROBE allows us to generate large amounts of data describing pathway operation under several operating conditions. I reduce that data into a quantitative metric that combines product titer, production rate, and enzyme expression (TREE score). By simplifying the complexity of available cell-free data to one value we can now quickly screen and rank pathways in the cell-free environment and provide useful information for cellular metabolic engineering.

We investigate parallel approaches in theoretical and experimental methods to build understanding of these materials and the potential they have toward orthopedic tissue engineering. There is a need in orthopedic and craniomaxillofacial surgeries for materials that are easy to handle and apply to a surgical site, can fill and fully conform to the bone defect, and can promote the formation of new bone tissue. Thermoresponsive polymers that undergo liquid to gel transition at physiological temperature can potentially be used to meet these handling and shape-conforming requirements.

The buyer's valuation depends on his privately known type and the unknown attributes of the object. The seller designs a disclosure policy with a publicly observable outcome and interacts with the buyer only after the information is revealed. We identify the condition on the underlying preferences that guarantees the optimality of full disclosure: if buyer types are ranked uniformly across states by their willingness to pay, the seller prefers to disclose all information about her product. Whenever this condition is violated, there always exist type distributions for which full disclosure is suboptimal. We also study the optimal information disclosure policy in cases in which the released information might affect the ranking of the types. In environments with two types, the seller prefers partial disclosure that never reverses the ranking and fully reveals states in which the net gain from restricting output by selling only to the higher type is above a certain threshold. In settings with many types, the optimal disclosure policy depends on the distribution of types in a more complicated way. We establish structural properties that the groups of types that purchase the object at different posteriors must fulfill under the optimal policy."", ""The second chapter, which is a joint work with Daniel Fershtman, studies the efficient resolution of partnership disputes where efficiency need not imply dissolution. The modeled endogeneity of dissolution is a departure from the partnership dissolution literature emanating from Cramton et al.

First, we show that unless a dispute is sufficiently severe, its efficient resolution is infeasible without external subsidy. Furthermore, we prove that the severity of a dispute has a non-monotonic effect on the cost of its efficient resolution. We also consider an alternative class of mechanisms and characterize the disputes for which a profit-oriented arbitrator benefits from a more conservative approach in opting for dissolution. The latter characterization has implications for the design of arbitration in environments in which the partners' decision to trigger a dispute is itself endogenous."", 'The third chapter describes a new stability concept for fractional matchings in two-sided markets in which agents can be matched with multiple partners over time.

We characterize this condition both geometrically and in terms of the underlying preferences. The geometric characterization reveals the relationship between the set of fractional matchings satisfying C-stability, the polytope of matchings, and the polytope of weakly stable fractional matchings. The preference-based characterization uses these results to provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the underlying preferences that a fractional matching must fulfill to satisfy C-stability. These findings also highlight the difference between strong stability and C-stability and identify the exact cases in which strong stability excludes matchings that can be implemented only by stable time schedules.']",1/1/2018,Economics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_607540\Szabadi_northwestern_0163D_14301.pdf,,,,,,,

Although CNC-reinforced polymer nanocomposites and all-cellulose nanomaterials have consistently exhibited enhanced thermomechanical properties, it is still challenging to establish effective structure-property relationships to link the nanoscale mechanics and nanostructures to their macroscale performance in a predictive manner. To this end, we introduce novel multiscale modeling approaches to investigate the thermomechanical response and biomimetic design of cellulose nanomaterials in this dissertation. For CNC-reinforced polymer nanocomposites, we employ all-atomistic modeling to account for interfacial mechanics considering the influence of matrix polarity, surface chemistry and modifications of CNCs, where these characteristics are used as input for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate relaxation dynamics near the CNC-polymer interfaces. This seamless multiscale approach is employed to establish a predictive structure-property relationship between the interfacial energy and glass transition properties of nanocomposites at a larger scale by drawing upon the quantitative analogy between thin films and nanocomposites. For all-cellulose nanomaterials, an atomistically informed coarse-grained model for CNCs are developed under the strain energy conservation paradigm to efficiently and accurately expand the computational power to larger spatiotemporal scales.

The US government’s wartime decision to abolish slavery without offering slaveowners compensation for the lost value of their slaves threatened to send this complex system of finance, founded on human property, into chaos. This dissertation explores the little-known history of white southerners’ resistance to uncompensated emancipation and their defense of their perceived right to own slaves. Southern and federal lawmakers and judges, as well as everyday southerners, argued over who ought to be responsible for the financial burden of emancipation. From 1864 until 1866, former slaveowners regularly demanded that the federal government or state governments reimburse them for the value of their freed slaves. Others argued that no one should be forced to repay debts associated with the former value of slaves until 1871. ', 'The extent to which white southern men and women held onto the belief that they were entitled to be paid back reminds us that even after emancipation, property rights in slaves were ingrained in state law, politics, and southern culture. White southerners shed enough doubt on the legality of wartime emancipation with their claims for compensation that their opponents passed a section in the Fourteenth Amendment and turned to the US Supreme Court to undermine them. These debates reveal the ongoing contests over the meaning and terms of emancipation during and after the Civil War.

MFM provides a fast way to obtain 3D information of the sample by simultaneously capturing multiple focal planes on a single camera shot. However, stacking the sub-images from different focal planes does not provide a good reconstruction of 3D image because of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and severe out-of-focus blur of the microscopy. I analyze different models of the imaging process for MFM and derive multiple ways of 3D image reconstruction. First, I present image reconstruction methods based on models that assume Gaussian noise in the observation. As a base algorithm, I present a total-variation (TV) regularized least squares (RLS) algorithm for image reconstruction. We have developed two different algorithms to improve the performance of image reconstruction by using (1) multiple-frame processing, and (2) joint parameter estimation through a Bayesian framework, respectively. Multiple-frame processing utilizes the information from neighboring frames in addition to the current frame to improve the image quality. For joint parameter estimation, maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) is used for automatic estimation of the regularization parameter as well as 3D image reconstruction. Poisson noise model is also investigated to handle the low photon resource of MFM. For this, I present an alternating directions methods of multipliers (ADMM) based image reconstruction algorithm.

However, research in social entrepreneurship and social innovation is still in infancy. This dissertation is motivated by one overarching question: How can social entrepreneurs and social ventures more effectively tackle social issues? To answer this question, this dissertation research presents three separate, yet interrelated studies using data gathered from three sources. Drawing on interviews with 53 Chinese social entrepreneurs, the first study uncovers that Chinese social ventures are most struggling with the tensions between the state and social welfare logics, as opposed to the conflict between the market and social welfare logics as suggested in a majority of prior studies. Moreover, the results reveal four strategies, two of which are unique in the authoritarian regime of China, that social ventures employ to manage the conflict between state and social welfare logics. Drawing on survey data with 293 nonprofit organizations in the United States and based on the recombination-based organizational innovation theory, the second study examines the internal and external communicative drivers of organizational innovativeness. Regression and mediation tests reveal two distinct mechanisms underlying administrative and technical innovativeness. Overall, findings highlight the critical role of developing diverse interorganizational partnerships and maintaining a high level of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) to improve administrative and technical innovation. However, using information and communication technologies (ICTs) for knowledge sharing with members in an organization and across organizations are conducive to technical innovation only. Finally, drawing on survey data with 318 nascent nonprofit organizations, social enterprises, and benefit corporations in the U.S., the third study investigates how varied degrees of institutional complexity influence social innovation outcomes. Structural equation modeling results reveal an inverted U-shaped curvilinear relationship between institutional complexity and organizational innovation and that an organization’s EO fully mediates the relationship between institutional complexity and organization innovation. Taken together, the findings of the three studies underscore the institutional, network, and organizational factors that influence organizational innovation. The findings of these three studies contribute to theoretical advancement in the study of organizational communication, ICTs, social networks, and organization studies.']",1/1/2018,Communication Studies,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_608113\Fu_northwestern_0163D_14306.pdf,,,,,,,

Microkinetic modeling is a powerful tool capable of examining oxidation processes at the mechanistic level to gain understanding and guide catalyst applications. This thesis developed microkinetic models for oxidation of organic substrates using novel and industrially-relevant catalysts. Understanding the role of free-radical and catalyzed oxidation within a system is critical to knowing the effect of catalysts and predicting behavior when adapted to a new process. In this work, microkinetic models examined the oxidation of alcohols, alkenes, and alkylbenzenes using free radicals and various catalysts.', 'Microkinetic modeling was applied to the oxidation of 1,3-propanediol in order to explain the atypically high selectivity to acrolein for an uncatalyzed process. The developed free-radical model did not exhibit enough activity to explain the observed experimental conversion. An initial concerted dehydration reaction is the most probable mechanism of increasing the overall rate of reaction. The dehydration reaction leaves behind a double bond, and the allylic hydrogen is more likely to be initiated by free radicals. The investigation of this system showed that for oxidized starting materials concerted reactions may play an important role in directing selectivity.', 'The microkinetic model was then expanded to the oxidation of cyclooctene catalyzed by gold nanoparticles. There has been significant interest in determining the role of small gold nanoparticles in catalyzing reactions. In order to reveal the role of ~5-8 atom gold clusters, the free-radical model was first validated against experimental data. Net rate analysis revealed that alkoxy and peroxy radicals prefer to add to cyclooctene as opposed to abstract hydrogen, giving rise to high (~80 %) selectivity to cyclooctene oxide. With the underlying chemistry defined, the role of gold nanoparticles was initiation of free radicals via hydrogen abstraction by superoxo gold species and hydroperoxide decomposition on gold sites. This makes gold nanoparticles interesting radical initiators, but they are not a plausible method for guiding selectivity of a system to epoxide products.', 'The established cyclooctene model was amended to account for the addition of another substrate, ethylbenzene, and a new catalyst, Co/ZSM-5. This model provided the opportunity to investigate the effect of kinetically coupling of the slower oxidation of ethylbenzene with the active oxidation of cyclooctene. Net flux analysis revealed that under conditions that have a high concentration of ethylbenzene, alkoxy and peroxy radicals derived from cyclooctene have a higher tendency to abstract hydrogen, initiating ethylbenzene oxidation. The alkoxy and peroxy radicals are more important in initiating ethylbenzene and driving secondary reactions to acetophenone than the zeolite catalyst, showing that kinetic coupling is a viable method of improving activity.', 'Finally, direct epoxidation reactions catalyzed by Ti/SiO2 were added to the extant free-radical model for studying oxidation of limonene. The complexity of limonene led to a far more complex free-radical behavior with diepoxide and 1,2-epoxide products being slightly preferred to a multitude of other minor products. For catalyzed oxidation, the system is highly selective to 1,2-limonene oxide, implying that the 1,2-double bond is the most vulnerable for oxidation in both cases. Examination of the mechanism revealed that the Ti/SiO2 catalyst can be in multiple active states with differing activities, emphasizing the importance of catalyst structure on oxidation.', 'The microkinetic modeling framework established in this work can serve as a platform to investigate a variety of oxidation systems. When built upon, the effect of catalysts can be quantified, and predictions can be made in order to improve oxidation processes.']",1/1/2018,Chemical and Biological Engineering,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_608149\Brydon_northwestern_0163D_14308.pdf,,,,,,,

I introduce methods for large scale Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulation of many rigid particles of arbitrary shape suspended in a fluctuating fluid. I study particles partially or fully confined by no-slip walls by combining high performance deterministic fluid solvers with high performance methods for generating Brownian displacements. I address a major challenge in large-scale BD simulations, capturing the stochastic drift term that arises because of the configuration-dependent mobility. I construct two temporal integration schemes which are viable for large scale simulations in both confined and unbounded physical domains in that they are essentially the same complexity as their deterministic counterparts. I validate and compare these schemes numerically by modeling suspensions of boomerang shaped particles sedimented near one or two confining walls. I also investigate the steady-state active motion in a dense suspensions of confined microrollers, whose height above the wall is set by a combination of thermal noise and active flows. I find the existence of two populations of active particles, slower ones closer to the bottom and faster ones above them, and demonstrate that the method provides quantitative accuracy even with relatively coarse resolutions of the particle geometry. Further, I use these methods to examine friction in a colloidal crystal driven across a corrugated substrate potential in a slit channel.

BSDs are characterized by emotion dysregulation at varying levels of severity. Frequently, individuals with a less severe BSD diagnosis frequently advance to a more severe diagnosis over time. Based on this tendency, early detection may be particularly critical for individuals on the bipolar spectrum. Previous research on BSD compares healthy individuals to severe forms of bipolar disorder. Although this approach is unable to dissociate correlates of vulnerability to BSD from correlates of BSD. To address this first gap in the literature, the present study compared individuals along a spectrum of risk to dissociate correlates of vulnerability for BSD from correlates of BSD. One critical risk marker of BSD may be the architecture of neural networks, particularly those networks involved in reward and emotion. However, no study has examined structural and functional network architecture of BSD along a spectrum of risk. To address this second gap in the literature, these analyses used a graph theoretical approach to examine both structural (diffusion tensor) and functional (resting-state) network architecture implicated in BSD across three network definitions: a) whole brain network composition, b) theoretically defined emotion generation/regulation subnetwork, and c) theoretically defined reward subnetwork. Within each of these network definitions, graph metrics were calculated as global metrics, nodal metrics, and theoretical internetwork hub regions.

Despite decades of research, many mechanistic questions remain in understanding how proteins fold into functional structures. Specifically, little experimental information exists about folding energy landscapes and which kinetic routes proteins take to fold. Investigation of protein folding dynamics remains experimentally difficult by conventional spectroscopic tools, such as optical transient absorption.  Many proteins do not contain native chromophores and therefore are not amenable to laser initiation methods. Furthermore, optical probes typically provide only indirect information about protein conformation. Time-resolved x-ray scattering (TRXSS) is a pump-probe technique that utilizes a laser pump and x-ray solution scattering probe to track the structural dynamics of proteins on multiple length scales, including secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures. However, previous TRXSS studies were limited to photoactive proteins that could be directly excited by a laser pump. ', 'This work presents the first implementation of laser-induced environmental perturbations coupled with TRXSS to study conformational dynamics in non-photoactive systems. We implemented a new sample delivery system that enabled three new TRXSS pump techniques: temperature-jumps (T-jumps), pH-jumps, and photoreduction. We utilized these methodologies on several protein systems to investigate various aspects of protein folding reactions: protein-protein association in insulin, metal-coupled folding transitions in cytochrome-c (cyt c), and alpha-helix formation in poly-L-glutamic acid (PGA) peptides. In the case of insulin association dynamics, TRXSS coupled with T-jumps revealed intermediate species that were not previously observed by optical techniques, which provide information about the late stages of protein-protein association. In the case of cyt c, TRXSS coupled with pH-jumps and photoreduction revealed the early dynamics of metal-coupled folding reactions. For PGA, TRXSS coupled with pH-jumps revealed a new intermediate state in the alpha helix folding process.

However, the repurposing of the long play record format (LP) by funk artists and their use of emerging sound technologies of the time (i.e. electric keyboard, funk bass, synthesizers, etc.) has been overshadowed by prevailing narrations of black pathology that figure the work of black musicians as natural and corporeal. Turning away from this pathology, my dissertation argues that funk, defined as a black cultural and philosophical phenomenon of the 1970s, theorizes the precarious ways that black subjects embody and perform their gender. Primarily reading across the sound recordings and LP album sleeves of black funk musicians of the 1970’s, I demonstrate that the artists under consideration cultivated funk grammars, principally album art and sound, to performatively theorize black subjectivity.', 'Using black critical theory, chiefly the work of black feminist theorists, to dislodge the specter of logocentrism from studies of funk, my dissertation holds in tension the relationship between black sound and black visuality as the trace of discourse that helps us to better understand theories of blackness and gender, which I term “black gender.” I elucidate the stranglehold logocentrism and ethnocentrism have on reading black popular music, as well as, the way black subjects are foreclosed from, yet constitute, the universal subjectivities of “man” and “woman.” As such, “They Say I’m Different,” interrogates the concept of gender and to a lesser degree, sexuality, as it relates to black subjectivity, through funk. Therefore, gender and sexuality, do not figure in my dissertation as a set of identitarian categories. Rather, I argue that the work of black funk musicians of the 1970s shows that the concepts of gender and sexuality affect black subjects instead of indexing the particularities of their gendering and sexualization.

How does literature come to count as belonging to or appertaining to a particular place? Today, in the international spheres of the university and the literary market, the Francophone novel has become the avatar of literary modernity in the Maghreb. This apparently natural birth of a new literary genre and the subsequent emergence of a field of study around it is belied by the multiplicity of relations among the texts that form the corpus of Maghrebi literature to the territory of the Maghreb itself. This dissertation studies novels from within that corpus that interrogate the relation of writing to geopolitical and linguistic territories. Collectively, they suggest that, insofar as there may exist a Maghrebi novelistic corpus, it crystallizes through a practice of literary ex-centricity, or non-correspondence with the territory called the Maghreb, to which it is said to belong.', 'Previously, scholars have linked the modern Maghrebi novel (be it in French, Arabic, or other languages) to its engagement with European literary models and to the politics of decolonization and nationalism, with their attendant questions of language and identity. This focus on formal and historical contingencies has placed Maghrebi literature in a double bind that overdetermines its relation to territory. To enter into the increasingly global, but also increasingly uneven, literary arena, Maghrebi novels must perform their difference from the self-styled universality of European literary paradigms by insisting on their specificity as Maghrebi. Faced with the injunction to be about this nation or that history, I read both canonical and lesser-known texts that unfold other places and times. Part One examines temporal displacements, from a re-writing of Maghrebi colonial history that fragments it from within in Assia Djebar’s L’Amour, la fantasia (1985) to distant pasts whose vision of the future does not coincide with the Maghrebi present in Jamel Eddine Bencheikh’s Rose noire sans parfum (1998) and Driss Chraïbi’s La Mère du Printemps (1982) and Naissance à l’aube (1986). Part Two focuses on spatial displacements through Hubert Haddad’s Le Peintre d’éventail (2013), a novel set in rural Japan that investigates the modes of relation between art and place and reconfigures the geography of Maghrebi literary modernity and European modernism alike. Each of these texts shares in its fundamental gesture of opening a gap between text and territory. This relation always remains to be determined, allowing virtuality to come to bear on actuality by asking how literature, even as it is always already being drawn into linguistic or national horizons of thought, may also be elsewhere or otherwise.']",1/1/2018,French and Italian,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_608545\Brauer_northwestern_0163D_14313.pdf,,,,,,,

Using a field experiment, the second study confirms these patterns and adds an additional paradox: more similar outgroup members encourage these kinds of interactions, but those same kinds of outgroup members are most likely to undermine outgroup support as the interactions unfold. The final experiment indicates that standing propensities to avoid outgroups do not moderate the effect of the ease of communicating and that different contexts may be more or less prone to the backlash observed in the prior two chapters.

In specific, we examine high impact applications of non-linear atomics and non-linear optics. First, we explore how the interesting coherence properties of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) can make it be a useful technology for nanolithography. BEC is a state of matter which can be described by a nonlinear version of Schrödinger equation. Atoms in a BEC have coherence properties at a macro scale which makes them a perfect candidate for atom interferometry applications. These coherence properties combined with a very short de-Broglie wavelength make BEC interferometry a strong candidate as a nanolithography technology that is capable of achieving lithographic features in the single nanometer scale. ', 'In this thesis, we propose an arbitrary-pattern nanolithography system based on BEC interferometry and define the practical constraints of such a system. The nanolithography system uses a symmetric three-pulse Raman atom interferometer. The lithographic pattern information is optically encoded into the BEC order parameter in one of the interferometer arms via ac-Stark shift induced by a pulsed laser field. The probability distribution of the BEC interference result is proportional to the required lithographic pattern. In order to produce lithographic features smaller than the diffraction limit for the used optical fields, a three-dimensional atomic lens system is utilized. ', 'In the second part of the thesis, we investigate how the nonlinear Brillouin gain process can be utilized in a coupled fiber resonator system to create a superluminal Brillouin laser. Such a laser would lead to multiple orders of magnitude sensitivity enhancement in optical fiber gyroscopes.  In Brillouin ring laser gyroscope, stimulated Brillouin scattering is utilized as a gain medium to generate two counterpropagating lasers in a fiber ring. When the system is rotating, the two lasers would have different resonance frequencies in the fiber ring. The resonance frequency separation is proportional to the rotation rate. Superluminal conditions, generated by auxiliary fiber rings coupled to the main fiber ring, lead to a much larger resonance frequency separation and a significantly better sensitivity. This thesis discusses the system sensitivity enhancement and the experimental efforts towards implementing this system. ', 'The third part of the thesis discusses how the plasmonic effects of metallic nano-antenna arrays can enhance the efficiency of difference frequency generation in nonlinear optical materials.  The fabrication of Au bowtie nano-antennas on Lithium Niobate using electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching is reported. The effect of the fabricated structures on the efficiency of difference frequency generation is investigated.']",1/1/2018,Electrical Engineering,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_608716\Fouda_northwestern_0163D_14318.pdf,,,,,,,

The outer mitochondrial membrane adapter proteins Miro1 and Miro2 play a role in the regulation of mitochondria. Each paralog comprises two GTPase domains flanking two centrally located calcium/magnesium-binding helix-loop-helix (EF-hand) domains. However, the biochemical and structural mechanisms by which Miro influences mitochondria are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal GTPase domain (nGTPase) of human Miro1, estimate the GTP-hydrolysis activity of Miro1 and Miro2, and propose evidence of both monomer and dimerization of the assembly of the full-length soluble domain of human Miro1 and Miro2. The nGTPase structure at 1.7 Å resolution shows an irregular active site, including backbone coordination of the magnesium ion by a carbonyl from the conserved Proline-Proline (“PP”) motif in Switch 1. Structural and biochemical analyses of the isolated N- and C-terminal GTPase domains demonstrate that the GTPase domains hydrolyze GTP on a day-to-week timescale, which is orders of magnitude less than the yeast homolog Gem1p. Using our crystal structures, SAXS and molecular modeling, we propose a three-dimensional structural model of the monomeric and dimeric soluble domains of Miro1 at low resolution. The homo-dimeric model suggests that assembly is mediated via a conserved Serine-Glutamate-Leucine-Phenylalanine-Tyrosine-Tyrosine “SELFYY” motif in the nGTPase. We also characterize the putative Miro GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) called Vibrio outer protein E (VopE) using bioinformatic analysis, homology modeling, SEC-MALS, SEC-SAXS, and NMR spectroscopy. These data suggest that the VopE GAP domain forms an elongated 4-helix bundle similar to other bacterial GAP proteins, but with increased internal flexibility and disordered termini. Altogether, we show that Miro is structurally and functionally distinct from “on/off switch”-like GTPases and its putative GAP VopE is most homologous to the Yersinia outer protein E (YopE) in structure.']",1/1/2018,Driskill Graduate Training Program in Life Sciences,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_608729\Smith_northwestern_0163D_14319.pdf,,,,,,,

However, until recently only forward techniques have been developed, to simulate the behavior of the electromagnetic field inside devices and materials coming from the imagination of a human being. ', '\tIn this 21st century, artificial intelligence replaces the human for more and more complex tasks. Electromagnetics will not miss this opportunity to bring tremendous computing power and powerful algorithms to automate the device design task, called inverse-design. In this work, we develop an algorithm to do inverse-design of dielectric devices with sizes in the order of magnitude of the wavelength. The algorithm is used to design and fabricate multiple types of electromagnetic devices for the manipulation of light on-chip or in free-space, with low index or high-index dielectrics, from the microwaves to the near-infrared and maybe the visible in the future.', '\tThis dissertation is organized as follows. Chapter 1 presents the wave equations, various approximations, various computational techniques to simulate electromagnetic fields and various types of electromagnetic devices based on the inputs, outputs and types of materials inside. Chapter 2 explains the theory behind inverse-design, the comparison between the algorithm in this work and some other algorithms in the literature, regularization methods and a few insights for the implementation. Chapter 3 demonstrates our first inverse-designed device: a two-dimensional optical diode made of Silicon and air. This chapter explores some details of the optimization process as a function of the number of iterations, and the tuning to select the best hyperparameters of the algorithm to optimize the performance of the final optical diode. Chapter 4 explores the design and fabrication of polymer meta-devices to transform free-space incoming electromagnetic radiation. Meta-gratings including polarization splitters and bends are demonstrated, as well as meta-lenses, one with short focal distance, one with long focal distance and one with tunable focal distance. The algorithm is adapted to new types of inputs and outputs such as plane-waves and cylindrical waves. The physical behavior of polymer-based devices, which have a low index, does not rely on strong resonances such as those observed in Silicon-based devices. This allows to design devices with a very large bandwidth. Furthermore, polymers can be 3D-printed, which allows to create devices with much more complex geometries and much larger aspect ratio than devices made with traditional lithography methods. In this chapter, we explore millimeter-scale 3D-printing to make microwave and millimeter-wave meta-devices, as well as nanometer-scale 2-photon lithography 3D-printing for the fabrication of a Near InfraRed polarization splitter.

Parenting is also one of the key pathways through which socioeconomic factors, such as maternal education, may impact young children (Conger & Donnellan, 2007). In addition, both parents and their children are embedded within multiple, dynamic environments that may shape the relationship found between parents and their children’s development, such as mothers’ and children’s experiences in school. ', 'Surprisingly, much of existing developmental research does not explicitly examine the associations between parents and their children as they exist within these dynamic educational contexts. For instance, a large body of correlational research has documented the strong associations between a mother’s education level and her children’s development, but we know little about the relationship between maternal education and children’s development when a mother’s education changes over the course of key developmental time points in her child’s life. In addition, are the mechanisms that explain associations between maternal education and child development the same if a mother attains her highest level of education before her children are born versus while she is raising her children? In my two-study dissertation, I draw on ecological theories of development and utilize multiple data sets to quantitatively examine the role of mothers’ parenting and educational attainment in young, low-income children’s development as embedded within these dynamic contexts of education.', 'In my first study, I examined the associations between maternal education, parenting practices, and young children’s cognitive, social, and behavioral development among low-income families in the context of attending Head Start preschool for their first year. In this study, I used cohorts 2000-2009 of the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) data and employed a classroom fixed effects analytic design to compare children to each other within the same classroom. This approach addresses the potential bias of parental selection into particular classrooms that vary in quality within center by netting out observed and unobserved, time-invariant characteristics of the child’s classroom. Findings indicated that more positive parenting practices and greater levels of maternal education were significantly related to children’s cognitive, but not behavioral or social, skills over the Head Start year, both when parental predictors were included separately or simultaneously in the analytic models. Results suggest that parenting and maternal education in the early years of a child’s life before they enter preschool may play a significant role in children’s later cognitive development, above and beyond the effects of Head Start preschool. ', 'In my second study, I explored how improvements in maternal education are associated with both children’s development (between the ages of 3 and 9 years old) and parental factors among a predominantly low-income sample of families in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) longitudinal data set. I also examined how the main associations varied by key moderators, including maternal age, income, and marital status. To test these research questions, I employed an individual child fixed effects analytic design to hold constant time-invariant characteristics of the child and mother, addressing this key source of unobserved omitted variables bias. I found that approximately 15% of mothers improved their education between when their children were ages 3 to 9. Increases in maternal education from less than a high school degree to attaining a high school diploma/GED were related to lower rates of children’s internalizing behavior problems, and improvements to a certificate/AA were related to improved receptive language. No significant relationships were found between improvements in maternal education at any other level or for other child outcomes, nor with measures of parental mental health. However, improvements in maternal education from starting with a high school degree/GED to attaining a certificate/AA were related to reduced harshness and a higher likelihood of being employed. In addition, starting with a certificate/Associates’ degree and completing a Bachelor’s degree or higher was significantly associated with higher household income. Findings suggest that increases in maternal education among disadvantaged mothers may have important and positive associations with young children’s behavioral and cognitive development. This is particularly true for mothers who start with low levels of education, suggesting that even among a sample of low-income families, the children of the most disadvantaged mothers may gain the most from improvements in maternal education.']",1/1/2018,Human Development and Social Policy,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_608854\Ross_northwestern_0163D_14322.pdf,,,,,,,

This dissertation studies causes and consequences of this famine. ', 'Chapter one evaluates the causes of the 1933 famine offered by historians in Ukrainian context. Three main explanations have been offered: negative weather shock, poor economic policies, and genocide. This chapter uses variation in exposure to poor government policies and in ethnic composition within Ukraine to study the impact of policies on mortality, and the relationship between ethnic composition and mortality. It documents that (1) the data do not support the negative weather shock explanation: 1931 and 1932 weather predicts harvest roughly equal to the 1925 -- 1929 average; (2) bad government policies (collectivization and the lack of favored industries) significantly increased mortality; (3) collectivization increased mortality due to drop in production on collective farms and not due to overextraction from collectives (although the evidence is indirect); (4) back-of-the-envelope calculations show that collectivization explains at least 31\\% of excess deaths; (5) ethnic Ukrainians seem more likely to die, even after controlling for exposure to poor Soviet economic policies; (6) Ukrainians were more exposed to policies that later led to mortality (collectivization and the lack of favored industries); (7) enforcement of government policies did not vary with ethnic composition (e.g., there is no evidence that collectivization was enforced more harshly on Ukrainians). These results provide several important takeaways. Most importantly, the evidence is consistent with both sides of the debate (economic policies vs genocide). (1) backs those arguing that the famine was man-made. (2) -- (4) support those who argue that mortality was due to bad policy. (5) is consistent with those who argue that ethnic Ukrainians were targeted. For (6) and (7) to support genocide, it has to be the case that Stalin had the foresight that his policies would fail and lead to famine mortality years after they were introduced (and therefore disproportionately exposed Ukrainians to them).', 'Chapter two complements the above analysis by studying the government grain procurement system, and its impact on the 1933 death toll in the context of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. By demonstrating that there was a positive correlation between grain production in 1932 and mortality in 1933, it reproduces the results of Meng et al. (2015) in the context of the 1933 Soviet Famine. The chapter argues that the inflexible procurement policy under which the government did not sufficiently adjust procurement quotas to realized harvest explains the peculiar positive correlation between grain production and mortality during the famine year.', 'Finally, the third chapter studies the impact of the 1933 Soviet famine on population and urbanization patterns. It documents that, although most of the direct victims lived in rural areas, the famine had a persistent negative impact on the urban population. In fact, the rural population gradually recovered while urban settlements in more affected areas became permanently smaller. The paper argues that the shortage of labor during the crucial years of rapid industrialization hindered the development of cities in areas struck by the famine. Thus, the timing of the shock to population appears to be an important factor. While established urban networks tend to recover from large temporary adverse shocks, the lack of people during construction and rapid growth might have a permanent negative impact.']",1/1/2018,Economics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_608896\Naumenko_northwestern_0163D_14323.pdf,,,,,,,

In 1952, India became the first country to institute anti-natalist population control as a national policy goal, concentrating its efforts on female sterilization and the building of medical family planning clinics. Beginning in the 1960s, however, the state launched a series of mass communications campaigns on family planning and contraception targeted at men. While prior scholarship glosses over these campaigns as mere accompaniments to its medical efforts, the dissertation argues that they represented a radical transformation of reproductive control in response to Cold War-era social science. Furthermore, it shows how this shift in approach transformed a largely medicalized program focused on the bodies of women into a simultaneously ideological endeavor to influence the reproductive decisions of men. The dissertation makes three primary contributions to sociological scholarship on reproductive governance. First, in contrast to explanations of reproductive governance that center on national factors, the dissertation demonstrates the influence of global political and scientific dynamics on reproductive control. Relatedly, while prior scholarship understands the postwar institutionalization of population control as largely a response to concerns over economic growth measured in quantitative terms, the dissertation argues that it was also driven by social scientists’ anxieties over the viability of capitalist democracy. Finally, prior scholarship on reproductive control centers on the medicalized and biomedicalized management of women’s bodies, which leaves little room for understanding the erstwhile control of men’s reproduction in India. Expanding this literature, I show how, in the Indian case, social scientists’ framing of reproductive control in psychosocial and behavioralist terms allowed men to be imagined as germane targets of fertility regulation.']",1/1/2018,Sociology,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_608969\Balasubramanian_northwestern_0163D_14325.pdf,,,,,,,

The focus of this thesis is on exploring how the statistical characteristics of visual textures relate to the perceived texture attributes.

A series of new electronic devices that interfaced directly with TV technology—video cameras, home recorders, cable boxes, video calling systems—were introduced to the American public. These devices promised to radically transform the medium. They worked to turn what had long been conceived as a one-way system of mass communication into an interactive and useful instrument in the management and relations of domestic life. My dissertation examines this televisual transformation. Combining archival research, discourse analysis, and close readings, it analyzes how television’s convergence with new media from 1960 to 1990 strove to redefine the medium, allowing for novel ways of engaging with the TV set that restructured and reimagined family communication and household operations. In particular, it contends that during this period both television and the idea of television transformed. In addition to being an object designed to be watched, television became a complex assemblage to be used. Once linked to these new technologies, television ceased to be the uniquely one-way receiver of broadcast signals, but became a flexible and interactive tool—a potent force in the management of the household, protection of the home, and the cultivation of the family.', 'My dissertation explores this history of television convergence by focusing on four case studies: home videomaking, video telephony, interactive cable, and home surveillance and security. It analyzes the discourses that surrounded each of these technologies and practices, unpacking the hopes they inspired and the fears they engendered as they interacted with the TV set and intervened in domestic life. In particular, my dissertation argues that these moments of technological linkage were imbricated with the structures of American domestic life. They emerged in response to changing configurations of home, gendered expectations, and the limitations and apparent decline of the nuclear family. In so doing, home videomaking, video telephony, interactive cable, and home surveillance and security functioned to offer visions of the future often rooted in nostalgic idealizations of the past. Although many of the technologies explored in this dissertation have been almost entirely eclipsed by or subsumed within computational media, television’s tenure as the communications center of the home must not be ignored. The modes of interaction, systems of surveillance, visions of domestic efficiency, and gendered assumptions they articulated did not disappear with the end of the 1980s. Far from merely a prehistory of the digital, the history of television convergence from 1960 to 1990 offers a vibrant and significant reimagining of the function of technology in the home, essential to understanding many of the practices that have come to define domestic life in the digital age.']",1/1/2018,Screen Cultures,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_609097\Spaulding_northwestern_0163D_14329.pdf,,,,,,,

Long-term euglycemia was achieved in rodents with the marginal number of islets (at a one donor per recipient level).

My methodology draws from black feminist theory and metaphors extracted from the natural and neurosciences. In so doing, I grapple with the following questions, as they relate to specific cases within the black aquatic: How does the figure of gestation appear as both deathly and vivified in the black aquatic? How does blackness travel as a queer contagion, or vector, within water? What does a topography of racial affect look and feel like? How do we make sense of black temporality—an element that has been denied futurity and rendered ahistorical, anchoring modernism all at the same time—within the oceanic, a space crosscutting zoological and cosmological time? How is black subjectivity represented as a synesthetic experience? Regarding the Caribbean and the Pacific, what are the biosocial components and historical stakes of black surf culture within neoliberal strictures of privatized land development? And, ultimately, how do the affective and spatial components of “vestibularity”—a term I borrow from Hortense Spillers— appear throughout the black aquatic?

This 30-year expanse marks a confluence of several socio-political and scientific phenomena: the galvanization of globalization; the increased awareness (and fantastical denial) of global warming and its antiblack machinations (e.g. Hurricane Katrina); the affective and sonic turn in the humanities from the 2000s and onward; the rise of embodied film theory (e.g., “sensuous cinema”); critical leaps in black cinema’s newfound visibility and experimental aesthetics, both in the art world and the major motion-picture market; and the institutionalization of Black Studies. As far as particular historical incidents, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the calculated malice behind water management in Flint, Michigan also serve as grave moments in the black aquatic whereby necropolitics and disaster capitalism converge in egregious proportions.

Hearing a teacher’s voice despite the scraping of chairs and the chattering of classmates requires that students effectively perceive speech in noise. As young children are more vulnerable to the detrimental effects of noise (Elliott, 1979; Fallon et al., 2002; Papso and Blood, 1989), those who struggle to perceive speech in noise are especially susceptible to academic challenges. Indeed, difficulty listening in noise is a hallmark symptom of many developmental disorders, including language and reading impairments, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and auditory processing disorder (Bradlow et al., 2003; Brady et al., 1983; Moore et al., 2010; Ziegler et al., 2005, 2009). ', 'Accumulating evidence suggests that in school-aged children (8-12 years old) and adults, speech-in-noise perception is facilitated by an interplay of neurophysiological, cognitive, and linguistic processes, with underlying factors including neural processing of acoustic cues (e.g., fundamental frequency and formant transitions), attention, working memory, and language competency (Anderson et al., 2013; Boothroyd, 1970; Eisenberg et al., 2000, 2002; Pichora-Fuller et al., 1995). A theoretical framework to understand how humans hear in noisy environments includes an integrated and dynamic network of auditory-cognitive function (Wingfield et al., 2005). Moreover, as speech-in-noise perception improves with age until adolescence (Elliott, 1979), children’s hearing in noise is also constrained by developmental factors. By focusing on auditory processing, cognition, and linguistic skills, in addition to the influence of development, this dissertation takes a multifaceted approach to understand the various factors supporting speech-in-noise perception in early childhood (ages 3-8). In addition to providing a conceptual and theoretical advance through the novel application of latent growth curve and structural equation modeling, this research fills a gap in our understanding of functional listening in early childhood, a developmental period that is largely understudied.', 'The first part of this dissertation extends previous observations of the neural mechanisms underlying speech-in-noise perception in older children and adults by examining these relationships in young children, ages 3-4 years. Findings demonstrate 1) intrinsic neural oscillations, or the synchronized excitation of neural ensembles at rest, may prime the brain for better perception of words in noise (Chapter 2), and 2) that the maturation of word-in-noise perception is paralleled by development of subcortical sound processing and cognition (Chapter 3). The second part of this dissertation builds upon these findings, shifting from mechanisms supporting word-in-noise perception to those important for sentence-level perception. Two important directions are pursued, including the consideration of 1) the dynamic system (i.e., development within an individual from ~age 3 to 8 years), and 2) the integrated system (i.e., relative contributions of cognitive, language, and neural factors). Results reveal the maturation of intrinsic oscillations (Chapter 4) and subcortical processing of sound (Chapter 5) continues well into childhood years and that speech-in-noise perception under various listening conditions relies upon both neural processing of acoustic cues and cognitive/language abilities (Chapter 6). Combining the data across chapters, this unique longitudinal dataset reveals how a child’s brain and behavior predict hearing in noise two years later.', 'Taken together, these findings demonstrate that listening in noise relies upon systematic and targeted aspects of neural and cognitive function within and throughout early childhood.  Identifying the relative contributions and interactions of the mechanisms underlying hearing in noise not only informs our understanding of this key communication skill, but should assist the development of interventions that specifically target the underlying challenges hindering speech-in-noise perception in young children.']",1/1/2018,Communication Sciences and Disorders,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_609144\Thompson_northwestern_0163D_14332.pdf,,,,,,,

Patients experience a host of limiting motor symptoms such as rigidity, tremor, and a paucity of controlled movement generation. These symptoms often correspond with a predominance of abnormally synchronous activity among neurons in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop, which moderates limbic, associative, and motor processes. This thesis focuses on the electrophysiological activity of one basal ganglia component, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and how it changes in mouse models of PD, with the aim of targeting its pathological behavior for therapeutic intervention. Herein, a combination of ex vivo electrophysiology, 2-photon imaging, optogenetics, chemogenetics, immunohistochemistry, and behavioral assays were employed to elucidate the circuit triggers, cellular mechanisms, and therapeutic targeting potential of aberrant STN activity."", ""The STN is situated at an intersection of excitatory and inhibitory inputs where it integrates incoming signals from the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop and excites the circuit's output structures. This synaptic integration is influenced by the timing of autonomously-generated action potentials that are produced rhythmically and continuously by STN neurons at rates typically between 5 and 20 Hz in the mouse, thus rendering the influence of synaptic input dependent on the neurons' recent intrinsic firing history. Several models of experimental PD exhibit a complete loss or a severe reduction in the frequency and regularity of autonomous firing in STN neurons during ex vivo electrophysiological recordings, including the acute 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) toxin lesion and the progressive genetic MitoPark mouse models tested in this study. While dopaminergic input from the SNc can modulate STN activity, its loss is not the cause of the parkinsonian firing phenotype because in dopamine-intact mice, chronic chemogenetic activation of D2 dopamine receptor-expressing striatal projection neurons (D2-SPNs, whose output is elevated in PD) is sufficient to reproduce the STN firing perturbation of the 6-OHDA model (in which the effect is occluded). The result of augmented D2-SPN inhibition of the inhibitory external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) is in turn a disinhibition of the downstream STN. Periodic GPe-STN inhibition is phase-offset with excitatory cortical excitation in the synchronously-oscillating parkinsonian brain, which generates greater activation of NMDA receptors (Rs) in STN neurons and elevated calcium influx through them. Indeed, autonomous STN activity was disrupted in dopamine-intact mice by ex vivo activation of NMDARs for 1 hr, but this effect was occluded in PD mice. Furthermore, knockdown of STN-NMDARs in PD mice prevented the loss of rhythmic autonomous firing after dopamine depletion. Altogether these results indicate that 1) elevated D2-SPN output that disinhibits the STN is responsible for triggering the firing perturbation in PD mice, and 2) STN NMDAR activation is both necessary and sufficient to produce the downregulation of intrinsic activity in PD mice."", ""Maintaining a hyperpolarized membrane potential is a metabolically costly endeavor, particularly in an autonomously firing and/or prolifically stimulated neuron. With additional Ca2+  influx through NMDARs comes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria that can engage intracellular signaling pathways and trigger metabolic adaptations to the neuron's electrochemical environment. In line with this theory, mitochondrial oxidation in STN neurons was elevated in 6-OHDA-treated mice, and acute breakdown of the ROS H2O2 ex vivo rescued autonomous firing, implying ROS generation in the STN may be translating NMDAR activation into a suppression of neuronal excitability. STN NMDAR stimulation has been shown to activate the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel, which hyperpolarizes the membrane and reduces intrinsic firing. H2O2 has also been shown to activate these channels, and indeed blocking KATP channels ex vivo restored intrinsic firing and occluded the rescue by H2O2 breakdown. These results argue that elevated STN NMDAR activation and Ca2+ influx leads to increased production of ROS and H2O2-mediated activation of the KATP channel, which downregulates autonomous activity."", ""Finally, STN neurons were chemogenetically activated to restore intrinsic excitability in PD mice. Ex vivo, chemogenetic STN activation in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice diminished the synaptic drive from optogenetically stimulated motor cortical inputs to the STN, an indication that normalized autonomous firing reduces the STN's propagation of incoming synchronous oscillatory activity. As abnormally synchronous activity corresponds with symptoms of PD, its reduction by restoring autonomous STN activity was predicted to ameliorate motor deficits in these mice. Indeed, chemogenetic activation of the STN reduced forelimb use asymmetry in the unilateral 6-OHDA mouse model. Thus, despite appearances that downregulation of STN activity in response to elevated NMDAR activation would be adaptive to resist excitotoxicity, an individual neuron's response to its immediate environment (e.g. energy availability and synaptic input) cannot take into account the entire circuit's interactions and output. This thesis argues the STN's reduction of intrinsic firing is ultimately maladaptive in the context of the parkinsonian brain, and its correction is therapeutic. This study therefore contributes to the PD field's understanding of pathophysiology in the STN following dopamine loss and suggests a novel therapeutic intervention to treat motor symptoms of the disease.""]",1/1/2018,Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program (NUIN),Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2019",Private,\etdadmin_upload_609278\McIver_northwestern_0163D_14336.pdf,,,,,,,

N pollution is also linked to the emission of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O), which has a global warming potential 310 times that of CO2. In addition, P in fertilizers critical for global food production is derived primarily from phosphate rock, a geographically concentrated nonrenewable resource. P scarcity is an emerging global challenge in its own right, and there is increasing interest in reuse of P from wastewater.', 'Microbial bioprocesses at Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs) play a key role in preventing nutrient pollution. Unfortunately, current processes are energy intensive, costly, and characterized by emissions of N2O. Paradoxically, N2O is also a powerful potential energy source, as evidenced by its use in propulsion and automotive applications. Recently, a novel nutrient removal process, Coupled Aerobic-anoxic Nitrous Decomposition Operation (CANDO) was introduced to remove N from wastewater and generate N2O as a biofuel. Here, we developed a second generation of CANDO, termed CANDO+P, that combines N removal and energy recovery via microbial N2O generation with biological P removal and recovery. Simultaneous N and P removal by CANDO+P will have the chance to make this process more promising and fit a new vision of wastewater treatment targeting resource recovery in addition to environmental and public health protection. ', 'A proof-of-concept of CANDO+P was provided via long-term operation of a lab-scale bioreactor treating synthetic wastewater with biomass enriched in denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms (DPAOs) for almost 1000 days. Over this period, stable denitrification performance with complete N and partial P removal coupled to high-rate and high-yield N2O production (>70% influent N) was achieved.  Biomass aggregate structure shifted during operation from predominantly flocs to a hybrid mixture of flocs and dense microbial granules. A comprehensive study of both reactor kinetics and the underlying microbial community was conducted to understand the structure and function of the microbiome within CANDO+P, and to shed light on mechanisms of N2O production in this system. Based on high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the reactor community rapidly shifted away from the inoculum under the selective pressures imposed mainly by high nitrite (NO2-, 40-50 mg-N/L) and phosphate (PO43-, 5-15 mg-P/L) in the synthetic wastewater feed. A denitrifying Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR) enrichment dominated by DPAOs, denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms (DGAOs) and other flanking organisms was selected. 41 near-complete draft genomes including two Candidatus Accumulibacter genomes (associated with clade IA and the first published genome associated with clade IC) were extracted through genome-resolved metagenomic sequencing to characterize genomic denitrification potential. To investigate kinetics of the selected microbial consortium, ex situ batch assays were performed to evaluate denitrification capabilities and denitrifying phosphate uptake with different nitrogen oxides (nitrate [NO3-], NO2- and N2O). Compared with aerobic EBPR reactors and other heterotrophic denitrifiers enrichments, the selected microbial consortium exhibited a strong preference for NO2- utilization, and the propensity to accumulate N2O in the presence of NO2-. ', 'To explain the mechanisms of N2O formation, three hypotheses were tested: (1) electron competition among denitrification enzymes, (2) the enrichment of Candidatus Accumulibacter (PAO) with truncated denitrification pathways, and (3) the selection of flanking organisms (non-PAOs) lacking nitrous oxide reductase (NOS), the terminal enzyme in the complete denitrification pathway. An observed imbalance of denitrification capabilities using different nitrogen oxides as electron acceptors suggested that electron competition was likely not the main driver of N2O formation in this microbial consortium. By screening denitrification genes within the 41 near-completed genomes, nitrous oxide reductase gene was discovered in the Accumulibacter genomes, but not in several flanking bacterial genomes. Taken together, our results suggest that the unusually high levels of N2O accumulation observed in this microbial consortium may be caused by a combination of different mechanisms, including the selection of flanking microorganisms with truncated denitrification pathways. These findings provide proof the feasibility of the CANDO+P bioprocess, and shed light on biological formation of N2O and P uptake by providing detailed information on the associated microbial community structure and function.']",1/1/2018,Civil and Environmental Engineering,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_609309\Gao_northwestern_0163D_14338.pdf,,,,,,,

But while many have engaged with the problem of animal rights and representation in his oeuvre, no one has done so in the terms which I propose. This project takes as its point of departure the writerly connection between Franz Kafka and Coetzee, which the latter has frequently evoked through explicit references in his fiction and personal utterances, as well as in his themes and language.', ' ', 'My work undertakes a sustained analysis of the relationship between the two authors, which brings to the fore questions of allegorical and literal interpretation. In particular, I explore embedded scenes of performance in Elizabeth Costello and “Ein Bericht für eine Akademie” and argue that Coetzee lays out a blueprint of human/non-human relationality that depends not on language, but on the body as a vehicle for performance. This, I argue, is different from the theories of embodiment that scholars such as Elizabeth Anker and Donna Haraway have outlined. Keeping this in mind, I question existing readings of Disgrace that interpret the protagonist David Lurie’s slow change throughout the novel as a moral transformation that is assisted by his relationships with animals. Interrogating the double-sided nature of representation as both advocacy and depiction, I draw attention to the uneven power dynamics inherent in Lurie’s often well-intended representations of others—particularly the dogs in his life.', 'Finally, this dissertation zeroes in on the tendency that Kafka and Coetzee share of using transcendental language to describe a secular world. Though some scholars have understood Coetzee’s use of terms like “salvation” and “grace” to come hand-in-hand with an embrace of animal life, I show how any positive association between animals and “redemption” in Coetzee is in fact troubled by their relationship to violence.

The free-standing, three-dimensional, and highly porous structure of the graphene hydrogel is composed of loosely stacked and cross-linked graphene sheets, resulting in higher specific surface area and increase in electrochemical active sites when compared to the two-dimensional graphene films.  Implementation of the graphene hydrogel materials were successfully demonstrated in both Li-ion battery and supercapacitor devices in this dissertation.  ', 'For battery application, a porous 3D graphene hydrogel composite embedded with Si nanoparticles coated with an ultrathin SiOx layer is successfully synthesized using a solution-based self-assembly process.  The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the porous, open cell 3D structure of graphene hydrogel, which provides a large internal space and flexible, electrically conductive graphene matrix that can accommodate volumetric changes of Si nanoparticles.  Its highly porous 3D structure of high specific surface area allows rapid diffusion of Li-ions and easy penetration of electrolyte, resulting in high specific capacity even at high current density.  ', 'A polyurethane supported graphene hydrogel composite was fabricated and used as flexible electrode material for supercapacitors.  Nano and micro-particles of electrochemically active materials, graphite and MnO2, were mixed with graphene oxide solution and then treated with a mechanical spray dry method.  The resulting powder consists of the said active materials wrapped with graphene oxide sheets.  The hydrophilic nature of the graphene oxide wrapping allows for even suspension of hydrophobic active materials in aqueous suspension.  Graphene hydrogel can then be synthesized through hydrothermal reduction of the aqueous suspension of such composite particles, with even distribution of active hydrogel throughout the hydrogel microstructure.  Through mechanical and electrochemical testing, the hydrogel electrode material demonstrated its capability as highly flexible supercapacitor electrode.  The resulting understanding in the fabrication and electrochemical properties of such composite system paved the foundation for the designs of future multifunctional electrode materials capable of withstanding high degree of elastic deformation.  ', 'Both the electrochemical and mechanical properties of this three-dimensional electrode material were studied in detail.  The formation of stress induced surface defects on graphene coating were reported in this dissertation.  These stress induced defects exposed edge planes of graphene layers to electrolyte solution and resulted in significantly increase in the electrochemical activity of the material.  Such phenomenon was not previously reported in literature and offered new insights on the effects of mechanical deformation have on interaction between electrolyte and flexible graphene based electrode.  The effects of intercalated monovalent and divalent cations have on the mechanical properties of the graphene hydrogel were also observed.  Graphene hydrogel samples were treated with solutions of monovalent and divalent salts.  The graphene hydrogel samples were able to retain trace amount of monovalent and divalent ions, resulting noticeable increases to the elastic modulus of the graphene hydrogel, particularly in samples treated with divalent cations Mg2+ and Ca2+.  The results correlate with previous studies conducted on two-dimensional graphene structure.']",1/1/2017,Materials Science and Engineering,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_609383\Yu_northwestern_0163D_14342.pdf,,,,,,,

The first chapter examines the local economic consequences of prisons using two complementary approaches. The first uses the openings of 230 prisons during the 1990s across the entire United States, and the second uses a quasi-experimental strategy that compares winning and rejected communities in prison site-selection competitions in Texas. I find that prisons decrease housing values by 2-4 percent and lead to substantial changes in neighborhood composition, specifically towards low socioeconomic status individuals. The negative housing value impacts are localized to the neighborhoods that are closest to the new prisons, while the economic benefits of prisons are spread across broader communities. In particular, counties where prisons opened experienced an increase in total employment driven largely by the jobs at the new prisons. Prisons thus fail to create substantial spillovers to other sectors or provide a major boost to local economies beyond the direct effect of prison employment. Lastly, I find that after the opening of a prison, local labor markets in treated counties are less responsive to macroeconomic shocks, consistent with the view that jobs at prisons are “recession proof.”', 'The second chapter, which is joint work with Seema Jayachandran and Pinchuan Ong, investigates how the price of heating affects mortality. A higher price reduces heating use, and exposure to cold has been linked to cardiovascular failure, respiratory infections, and other health problems, and is a hypothesized contributor to the pattern of “excess winter mortality.” Heating prices could also affect health if high energy bills lead to cutbacks in food or health care spending. Our empirical approach combines spatial variation across the United States in the energy source used for home heating and temporal variation in the national prices of different energy sources; whether natural gas or electricity is used for heating varies significantly across counties, and the relative price of natural gas to electricity varies over time, notably due to the boom in shale production of natural gas during our 2000 to 2010 study period. Using microdata on all deaths in the U.S., we find that a lower heating price reduces winter mortality. The effect is due mostly to cardiovascular and respiratory causes of death. ', 'The third chapter takes its motivation from one of the key results in my first chapter. That is, prisons, by changing the sectoral composition of local economies, affect how local labor markets respond to shocks. This chapter takes as its central issue the volatility of local labor markets, which can be an important determinant of the welfare of local households. I start by characterizing spatial variation in employment volatility across local labor markets in the U.S. I show that there is substantial variation across and within states of the U.S., and larger and urban labor markets have lower volatility. Conditional on population size, areas with higher average wages also have higher volatility. I then investigate the roles of local industrial composition in explaining these variations, focusing on three key characteristics of local industrial mix: (1) the degree of industrial concentration, (2) the volatility of local industries, and (3) the degree of co-movement between industries. My finding indicates that industrial concentration and the degree of co-movement between industries are strong predictors of volatility. Local labor markets with more concentrated industrial structure, and bigger shares of industries that fluctuate more together have higher volatility. There is also suggestive evidence that these factors partly explain the observed trade-off between higher wages and higher volatility. Overall, my findings stress the importance of incorporating interactions between local industries in explaining fluctuations of local labor markets.']",1/1/2018,Economics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_609403\Chirakijja_northwestern_0163D_14343.pdf,,,,,,,

In contrast to mitosis, oocyte meiosis in many species occurs in the absence of centrosomes, the microtubule organizing centers that nucleate microtubules and help to define the spindle poles. We have used C. elegans oocytes as a model system to study the mechanisms by which chromosomes congress and segregate on these acentrosomal spindles. ', 'C. elegans oocytes use a chromosome segregation mechanism that is independent of end-on kinetochore microtubule attachments and instead utilizes lateral attachments and depends on a complex of proteins containing AIR-2/Aurora B kinase that forms a ring around the center of each homologous chromosome pair (Ring Complex, RC). These RCs facilitate congression during metaphase and then are released from chromosomes in anaphase and progressively disassemble as the chromosomes segregate. In this dissertation, we first demonstrate that RC disassembly and other aspects of normal anaphase progression are delayed in response to a variety of meiotic errors, revealing a regulatory mechanism for anaphase progression as well as a novel checkpoint-like mechanism that may function to allow errors more time to resolve. Next, we uncover mechanisms underlying the dynamic regulation of the RCs, revealing a general strategy by which protein complexes can be progressively remodeled. We find that the stability of the RC is regulated by a balance of SUMOylation and deSUMOylation activity and that the SUMO protease ULP-1 enables RC disassembly during anaphase. Finally, we provide further evidence that these unique chromosome segregation mechanisms function in the context of stabilized lateral microtubule attachments that persist through anaphase. These findings contribute to the overall understanding of cellular checkpoints, anaphase progression, and protein complex regulation during dynamic cellular processes.']",1/1/2018,Interdepartmental Biological Sciences (IBiS) Graduate Program,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_609406\Roca_northwestern_0163D_14344.pdf,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, applications of the model have been severely limited by the requirement that novel free energies must be constructed for each new material of interest. This thesis describes three different methods by which the basic PFC model has been extended to simulate additional materials and also demonstrates that these new models capture some of the physics of real materials.', 'The first extension is the development of a PFC model for a multicomponent ordered crystal. As a test case, a generic B2 compound is investigated. This model produces a line of either first-order or second-order order-disorder phase transitions, depending on parameters. This B2 model is then used to study antiphase boundaries (APBs), which are shown to reproduce classical mean field behavior. Lastly, we found through dynamical simulations of ordering across small-angle grain boundaries that the model predicts that dislocation cores pin the evolution of APBs.', 'The second extension is a method that, utilizing a numerically tractable three-point correlation function, creates an array of new complex three- and two-dimensional crystal structures. The three-point correlation function is designed in order to energetically favor the principal interplanar angles of a target crystal structure. This is achieved via an analysis performed by examining the crystal’s structure factor. This approach successfully yields energetically stable simple cubic, diamond cubic, simple hexagonal, graphene layers, and CaF2 crystals. To illustrate the ability of the method to yield a particularly complex and technologically important crystal structure, this three-point correlation function method is used to generate perovskite crystals.', 'The last extension is for a two-component PFC model that undergoes displacive phase transitions. When the intercomponent free energy in the model is a simple polynomial, the crystal undergoes displacive transitions in <10> and <11> directions. When the interaction is a correlation function however, displacements in any direction can occur. This displacive phase-field crystal (DPFC) model also maps to Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) theories for ferroelectrics, and the DPFC and LGD models are compared in terms of phase transitions and domain walls. The DPFC model also displays stable quadrijunctions and pinning of domain wall evolution by dislocation cores.']",1/1/2018,Chemical and Biological Engineering,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_609434\Alster_northwestern_0163D_14345.pdf,,,,,,,

One of the primary challenges in studies of cementitious materials such as concrete comes from the fact that multiple chemical reactions are happening in parallel. Environmental conditions present another challenge as they can influence greatly chemical kinetics, further complicating the analysis. The deterioration mechanism studied in this thesis is a chemical reaction called Alkali Silica Reaction (ASR) wherein an expansive gel is formed causing significant concrete degradation over time.', '\tASR induced degradation of concrete is first investigated through experimental methods to assess ASR affected concrete mechanical properties evolution over one year. The influence of environmental properties, aggregates silica content, aging, shrinkage, creep and sample geometry on ASR are fully characterized through a comprehensive experimental program involving destructive and non-destructive evaluations of reactive and non-reactive concrete samples at different stages. \\newline', '\tWhile experimental investigations happen to be the first step in the study of physical phenomenons, practical limitations in physical testing have constantly led researchers to develop numerical models capable of modeling accurately concrete properties. Besides, the long term assessment of concrete properties evolution is only achievable through the development of powerful models that can couple realistically the aforementioned physical phenomenon. The Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM), a three-dimensional mesoscale discrete model, is employed in this study to simulate the mechanical response of concrete at the level of coarse aggregate pieces. The LDPM is capable of characterizing strain localization, distributed cracking in tension and compression, and to reproduce accurately post peak softening behavior. The M-LDPM, an extension of LDPM, includes multiple models that describe heat transfer, moisture transport as well as  ASR, creep, aging, shrinkage, fiber contribution to concrete strengthening and their full coupling. The M-LDPM is calibrated and validated by modeling the experimental results obtained during the initial phase of the ASR study.', '\tHigh costs associated with concrete structure rehabilitation has pushed researchers to develop a new promising generation of self-healing concretes. As their name suggests, self-healing concretes are capable of mitigating damages associated with a given deterioration mechanism (ASR for example) by automatically regenerating themselves post-damage. This feature is crucial in the mitigation of deterioration mechanisms since fractures behave like hydraulic pathways, significantly increasing local permeability and promoting water ingress. The presented work includes an experimental study characterizing the effects cracks and of a self-healing admixture (Penetron) on concrete permeability.

We develop a mathematical model for the origin of this phenomenon. We ground the model on the ""strength of weak ties"" theory from sociology and treat social interaction as a random process.  The model suggests that the increased likelihood of finding required collaborations in a larger population can explain this superlinear scaling.

This NP@MOF composite is chosen as a probe catalyst due to its previous use in regioselective hydrogenation reactions. CO adsorption DRIFTS first reveals a striking difference between the available binding sites on Pt@ZIF-8 versus available sites on a supported metal control, PVP-covered nanoparticles on SBA-15. Redshifted linear and bridging CO adsorption sites on Pt@ZIF-8 suggest an electronic donation from ZIF-8 to the nanoparticle. This hypothesis is substantiated by 1H NMR, which confirms the binding of 2-methylimidazole to Pt nanoparticles. Knowing this, density functional theory calculations are used to compare CO adsorption on bare Pt(111) to CO adsorption on Pt(111) with an adjacently bound ZIF-8 linker, 2-methylimidazole. The magnitude of the calculated redshift is similar to that found using DRIFTS, and this study demonstrates the ability of 2-methylimidazole to donate electron density to a Pt surface. CO oxidation is performed in situ with DRIFTS to determine the active sites on Pt@ZIF-8. This work provides the first example of characterizing the nanoparticle surface within a MOF, improves the NP@MOF surface model for future studies, and validates the importance of applying established characterization techniques to novel catalysts.', 'The second part of this thesis comprises the synthesis, characterization, and reaction testing of Pd@UiO-66-NH2-25, a new NP@MOF synthesized via the controlled encapsulation method. The numerous trials to synthesize this composite are outlined to stress the specificity of this synthesis. The successfully synthesized composite is characterized using the techniques outlined in the Pt@ZIF-8 study. The intended goal of this synthesis is to establish a controlled encapsulation technique for a MOF with pores large enough to test cyclic reactants for regioselectivity, so furfural hydrogenation is thus chosen as a test reaction. While Pd@UiO-66-NH2-25 exhibits metal-catalyzed regioselective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, the major product in this reaction is from an acid-catalyzed side route. Because of this, catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural is elected to directly test for Lewis acid catalytic ability. Pd@UiO-66-NH2-25 shows impressive activity for the reaction and produces furfuryl alcohol in high yields. To supplement this study, the acid sites of Pd@UiO-66-NH2-25 are quantified using potentiometric acid-base titration. Finally, as a probe reaction for bifunctionality, benzyl alcohol oxidative esterification is used to demonstrate both metal catalysis and acid catalysis in Pd@UiO-66-NH2-25. While the chosen reaction is less ideal than expected for this proof of concept study, bifunctionality is demonstrated through the making of methyl benzoate. As a whole, this study underlines the importance of characterizing both the encapsulated metal and the MOF in NP@MOF composites and shows the potential for using NP@MOF composites in tandem or one-pot reactions in the future.

Alternatively, processes with combined actions of local deformation and heating, such as Electrically-assisted Incremental Sheet Forming (EA-ISF), are attractive when compared to conventional methods due to their increased process flexibility, decreased equipment capacity requirements, and shortened production cycles. In EA-ISF, the absence of a geometry-specific punch and die makes this process ideal for industries with small batch production runs. A few technical issues, however, hinder the wide commercialization of EA-ISF. Major roadblocks include the limited geometric accuracy of the final parts, unstable electric circuits during processing and the lack of in-depth knowledge on the material’s responses during processing and on the achieved product properties such as formability, hardness, surface topography and fatigue. Additionally, the dominant mechanisms behind electrically-assisted manufacturing processes remain a debatable research topic. ', 'To address the aforementioned issues, this work aims to: 1) improve the geometric accuracy of the final parts along with process efficiency, 2) realize the capability of deforming materials that are hard-to-form at room temperature, 3) unveil the dominant mechanisms behind the coupled electro-thermo-mechanical loading, and 4) enhance the performance of materials processed by EA-ISF.', 'Specifically, this thesis develops a novel hybrid ISF process that synergizes the desirable features of two different ISF processing modes. This strategy, in which the material is pre-strained followed by a low-force fine-tuning process, ensures the robustness, doubles forming efficiency and secures contact between the tools and the sheet metal. As such it was used as the basis for the development of two alternative variants of hybrid EA-ISF processes. Using this method, the forming depth has been increased by 115% compared to conventional EA-ISF. A practical post-forming annealing process that significantly increases geometric accuracy (up to 95%) is developed thereafter. This thesis discovers that apart from sparks, large forming forces limit the capability of deforming hard-to-form material in EA-ISF as well. ', 'To identify the dominant deformation mechanisms under electro-thermo-mechanical loading, a novel in situ characterization method for the material’s microstructure responses under macroscopic EA tensile loading is established. Combining both the material’s macroscopic and microstructural responses, this thesis refutes the existence of electrical-specific athermal effects in Ti6Al4V, regardless of the different patterns of electricity applied. Finally, an in-depth investigation of the resulting microstructures and material properties, obtained in ISF processes, is carried out. This thesis reveals the key factors that affect the material’s formability, hardness, surface quality, and fatigue life.', 'The ability to easily and rapidly manufacture sheet metal parts with the desired geometric accuracy and material properties, will unlock an entirely new design domain in product development that will allow for the continuing improvements in the processing and use of strong, lightweight parts in manufacturing industries. The methods and results generated in this work will contribute to the understanding and development of other manufacturing processes that are flexible or hybrid in nature.

It is hypothesized that control over the intermolecular interactions and supramolecular self-assembly of these systems could tune electronic properties and discover new functions. To that end, a series of co-crystals were designed, incorporating a naphthalene electron donor and pyromellitic diimide acceptor molecules, following the paradigm of lock-arm supramolecular ordering (LASO). While these co-crystals traditionally grow with 1:1 association between acceptor and donor molecules, the co-crystal of 1-amino-5-naphthol and diethylene glycol-functionalized pyromellitic diimide grew with a 2:1 acceptor to donor ratio, where the molecules orient themselves for charge transfer in nearly orthogonal face-to-face and edge-to-face mixed stacks. The co-crystals, while crystallographically centrosymmetric gave rise to second harmonic generation, which indicates noncentrosymmetric structure. In addition, they displayed room-temperature ferroelectric polarization, a consequence of electron transfer and hydrogen bonding, along two distinct crystallographic axes. Building on the LASO paradigm, a second series of co-crystals were developed, where the diethylene glycol ""arms"" were functionalized on the donor instead of the acceptor. While changing the donor chemistry did not change the crystallographic refinement of the co-crystals, it did influence the measured nonlinear optical and electronic properties. Specifically, the co-crystal with 1,5-diaminonaphthalene displayed second harmonic activity and room-temperature ferroelectricity. Reducing the nucleophilicity of the electron donor by switching the functional groups on the donor from amines to ester, on the other hand, neither generated ferroelectric not second harmonic activity. This observation links the strength of the electron donor molecule to the breaking of inversion symmetry and observation of stable ferroelectric polarization. Attempts to make charge transfer complexes more amenable to solution processing saw the development of two series of donor and acceptor molecules, one with complimentary urea and sulfonamide hydrogen bonding groups, and the other with added amino acids. The choice of urea-sulfonamide chemistry promoted heterodimeric charge transfer association between the donor and acceptor molecules upon co-assembly in organic solvents. Casting the co-assemblies onto a film, however, resulted in the phase separation of the two molecules into their respective supramolecular assemblies. Residual charge transfer in the phase separated films, likely due to dopant molecules within bulk supramolecular assemblies, led to an increase in thin-film conductivity by two orders of magnitude when compared against that of separate donor and acceptor films. In addition, the importance of hydrogen bonding in driving long-range supramolecular order and forming conducting pathways between electrodes was established by the lower thin-film conductivities of molecules without urea and sulfonamide functionalities. The second set of solution-based charge transfer complexes, where naphthalene and naphthalene diimide aromatic cores were functionalized with short tetrapeptide sequences, revealed pH-sensitive self-assembly and co-assembly in aqueous media. Having established that fluorescence emission quenching of the self-assembled donor is a consequence of intermolecular charge transfer between the donor and acceptor moieties, quenching was used as a metric for supramolecular exchange between assemblies of donor and acceptor molecules. Despite modulating the molar fraction of donor and acceptor moieties within the supramolecular nanostructures, inter-fiber exchange occurred far faster than that observed between non-interacting supramolecular assemblies. This implies that the driving force for exchange is dominated by charge transfer interactions. In addition, the placement of the aromatic moieties within hydrophobic segments of the amphiphilic molecules implies that charge transfer-mediated exchange requires the dissolution and re-assembly of the supramolecular assemblies to facilitate intermolecular association and inter-fiber exchange.']",1/1/2018,Materials Science and Engineering,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_609650\Narayanan_northwestern_0163D_14355.pdf,,,,,,,

These properties make GO an attractive building block for constructing various forms of bulk graphene-based materials. Layer-to-layer stacking, either between sheets or in the form of folds, are the fundamental structural feature in all graphene-based bulk materials. Research in this dissertation clarifies a misunderstanding of the inter-layer interactions in stacked GO sheets and demonstrates the implications of the new insights in better understanding of GO properties and new ways to use this material. ', 'First, a mystery about the stability of GO membranes in water is presented - GO membranes are known to be highly stable in water, but they should disintegrate since individual GO sheets dissolve in water very well. We discovered a long-overlooked factor behind this puzzling contradiction. Our findings show that pristine GO membranes indeed disintegrate in water; however, ionic contaminants unintentionally introduced during synthesis and processing of GO cross-link the sheets and make the film stable in water. One of the overlooked sources of contamination is the porous anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) filter membrane, which can readily corrode during filtration of GO dispersions to release Al3+.', 'This new insight is crucial to understanding the intrinsic properties of GO-like lamellar membranes. First, it explains why some earlier reports could use GO papers as separation membranes in water. And it reminds researchers that it is the multivalent ionic contaminants that hold the GO membranes together in water; the presence of which should be considered when interpreting the ionic transport results. Second, it resets the baseline understanding of the mechanical properties of GO papers. In many previous studies, the Young’s modulus values of GO papers were actually measured with Al3+ cross-linked GO papers. Therefore, the stiffness of neat GO papers should be significantly smaller. ', 'The insight also leads to the development of a “cut-and-paste” approach to turn GO papers into complex and even dynamic three-dimensional structures. Since the layer-to-layer interactions can be weakened by introducing water, it suggests that all pristine GO structures are reversible (i.e., they can be re-dispersed in water). Indeed, water was found to be able to heal damaged GO papers, reconnect separated GO pieces, and release internal stress in strained GO papers to fix their shapes. Such approach is complementary to origami and pop-up-based fabrication techniques for creating functional 3D structures from paper-like precursors. ', 'Lastly, a GO-water continuum with continuous transitions between states of a dilute dispersion, a thick gel, a malleable dough, and a dense solid is demonstrated, as the water content decreases. The GO dough is found to be highly processable and exhibit super extensibility. Dense solids with isotropically packed sheets, lamellar films, and porous foams can be readily fabricated from the dough state. Overall, the GO dough shows its potential as a versatile starting material to construct bulk GO, and potentially graphene materials with tunable shapes and microstructures.']",1/1/2018,Materials Science and Engineering,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_609695\Yeh_northwestern_0163D_14357.pdf,,,,,,,

Faculty and staff, known as institutional agents, can provide critical forms of institutional knowledge, resources, and services that can enhance the college experience and encourage student success. For Latinx students, who are disproportionately first-generation college students, these connections can make a significant difference since they may lack access to individuals in their family networks who can help them to navigate college and manage academic demands.', 'Even though Latinx students have much to gain by creating a campus support network, research suggests that they often have low levels of engagement and fail to foster institutional ties. However, the reasons why Latinx students struggle to form these connections, especially in their first-year when they most need support, have not been well documented; nor has this topic been examined at Hispanic Serving Institutions, even though they enroll more than half of all Latinx college students. Further, the current body of literature focuses on the frequency or quality of interactions between Latinx students and campus faculty and staff but fails to explain why these students encounter barriers and to consider the relational dynamics between students, the individuals who work in a college, and the college environment. ', 'Drawing on repeated interviews with 30 Mexican American first-generation college students enrolled in their first year of study at a four-year HSI, and interviews with 26 college faculty and staff, I utilized a social capital framework to examine the factors that negatively shaped how they perceived the supportive potential of campus staff and ultimately discouraged help-seeking behaviors during times of academic and personal need. Social capital refers to the benefits inherent in social relationships, while help-seeking is a primary way students can establish ties with institutional agents and access the resources available through these connections. After analysis of the data, the following three findings emerged: ', '1.\tThe college environment operated in myriad ways to promote a culture of independence that led students to feel a need to cope with and manage challenges related to the college experience solely on their own. Students also felt acting independently in college as preparation for adulthood and key to success post-college. These factors made them openly embrace independence as normative behavior as college students and downplayed the supportive potential of campus agents. Additionally, as some students moved through different spaces in a college setting, they also found inefficiencies in service delivery that impacted how they viewed agents as helpers and discouraged their use of available resources.', '2.\tSome students perceived the role and areas of support of academic advisors in limited ways. Some also felt a lack of support when it came to making decisions that would impact their college journeys. Finally, some students dealt with challenging life experiences that compromised their ability to trust campus agents. These three factors were present when examining the dynamics between students and academic advisors.', '3.\tThough designated Hispanic-Serving, there was a disconnect between institutional identity and mission that affected the university’s ability to communicate a sense of support to the Latinx student population. As a result, members of the university worried that this mismatch disrupted students’ desires to lean on them during times of need. ', 'Based on the findings, I conclude that colleges must proactively demonstrate the supportive potential of campus staff to promote positive help-seeking orientations and facilitate connections between students and college faculty and staff. For colleges to accomplish this objective, they must create a culture of care and find ways to close the distance between students and campus staff.']",1/1/2018,Sociology,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_609723\Mastrangelo_northwestern_0163D_14358.pdf,,,,,,,

The existence of DNA has been known to us for over a century, however, our understanding of its physiochemical nature and spatial organization inside our cells is ever evolving. Since the momentous discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA, the emergent view of DNA as a long biopolymer that proteins manipulate via physical interactions has been very successful in explaining experimental observations and proposing biological mechanisms. Since DNA resides in an environment where thermal fluctuations are omnipresent, statistical-mechanical properties of DNA play an indispensable role in protein-DNA interactions. Topological constraints are an essential feature of cellular DNA. Active control of both the intra-DNA topology, arising from the double-helix structure, and the inter-DNA topology due to its long length and self-avoidance, is an important characteristic of various biological functions. This dissertation contains theoretical models of double-helix DNA and other biologically-relevant DNA structures, such as two intertwined DNAs, where we view the double helix as a semiflexible elastic rod or a worm-like chain with an inherent twist stiffness. Our results explain torsion-induced buckling in stretched double-helix DNAs and intertwined DNAs that are in good quantitative agreement with existing experiments. New experimental data, resulting from collaborations, that successfully verified theoretical predictions are also reported. Some of our novel findings shed light on the role of certain structural defects in modulating DNA-buckling behavior, and the influence structural bulkiness may have on the stability of buckled DNAs. We also address a long-standing question of topological simplification of cellular chromosomes via modeling chromosome as a polymer bottle-brush or a cylindrical array of DNA loops. Our finding, inter-chromosome entanglements can be minimized by an optimal-loop length, may suggest that chromosome domains in interphase nuclei or “Topologically Associating Domains” (TADs) play a role in entanglement minimization. Loop extrusion, that has been recently proposed as a mechanism to compact chromosomes during the cell cycle, provides an active process to control the compaction state of chromosomes within our model. Our model of loop-extruded chromosome is quantitatively consistent with experiments reporting the rigidity modulus in chromosomes, which in our case, derives from a cylindrical core of densely packed DNA. The theoretical models described here make testable predictions, that we hope, will help design future experiments and uncover new phenomena, creating a need for novel theoretical techniques.']",1/1/2018,Physics and Astronomy,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_609727\Brahmachari_northwestern_0163D_14359.pdf,,,,,,,

Essay 1 and Essay 2 cover completed research, while the research covered in Essay 3 is at a more preliminary stage.', 'Essay 1: Starting Cold: The Power of Social Networks in Predicting Non-Contractual Customer Behavior', ""In this work, we provide an integrated framework for marketing managers on how to appropriately measure and manage customer behavior in a non-contractual setting in the presence of social network data. Customer behavior is directly tied to customer lifetime value (CLV) and customer equity (CE). Predicting customer behavior and their spending patterns, and consequently CLV, in such settings is a very challenging problem due to the absence of a formal declaration of termination of the customer-firm relationship. This implies that inactivity does not necessarily signal the end of the relationship, as a user may temporarily become dormant, and return at a later point in time. Distinguishing between dormant and churned consumers is a hurdle for marketeers who need to allocate their limited resources in a way that increases the overall value of a business’s customer base. Another important implication of non-contractual relationships is evident in customer-based corporate valuations (CBCV). Performing a CBCV requires knowing ahead of time how long a customer will remain with the firm, which inevitably makes non-contractual businesses prone to misvaluations. Therefore, any improvement in the ability to predict behavior in non-contractual settings is highly valuable. In this work, we study the extent to which knowledge of a customer’s social network can enhance the accuracy of forecasting their behavior in terms of future: (1) activity, (2) transaction levels and (3) membership to the group of best customers. We conduct a dynamic analysis on a sample of approximately one million users from the most popular peer-to-peer (P2P) payment application, Venmo. Our models produce high quality forecasts and demonstrate that social networks lead to a significant boost in predictive performance primarily during the first month of a customer's lifetime, thus providing a remedy to the “cold-start” problem. Finally, we characterize significant structural differences with regard to network centrality, density and connectivity between the top 10% and bottom 90% of users immediately after joining the service. We discuss how these structural dissimilarities provide a path towards proactive marketing and improved customer acquisition efforts."", 'Essay 2: Finding Strong Ties in a Facebook Haystack: A Multilayer Social Network Approach', 'In this work, we investigate the question of identifying the strong ties of an individual by just inspecting the person’s underlying social network structure. Strong ties have been documented to play an influential role in people’s decision making process across various settings. From our decision to donate goods to our decision to turn up and vote at the elections, strong ties are the ones who exert the greatest influence on us as they convey greater trust. The digital age has re-emphasized the importance and complexity of this task, as more and more companies have now access to online friendship data of their customers. We use and extend the ""social bow tie"" framework introduced in \\cite{bowtie} and apply it to a unique dataset from Venmo, the most popular P2P mobile payment application, to expand our knowledge on tie strength prediction. Our dataset is unique because it combines two different but overlapping social networks. On the one hand, we have the Venmo social graph, which comprises of all friend relationships of users that signed up with Facebook (FB). On the other hand, we have the Venmo transactional graph which reflects offline transactions among users. By following the money trail, we are able to differentiate with whom a user is really closely connected to among his FB friends, and we study the extent to which knowledge of a customer’s egocentric FB social network can enhance the accuracy of forecasting whether two individuals: (1) will transact at least once, (2) whether this transaction will be reciprocated and (3) their total number of transactions. Our models produce high quality forecasts for the tasks of predicting the formation of a financial relationship and its reciprocity, yielding final Accuracy scores in the range of 43%-90% and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) values in the range of 85%-98%, depending on the exact problem formulation.  For the task of predicting the total number of transactions between a pair of users, we get a Mean Square Error (MSE) in the range of 7.38-25.48 and an R-squared in the range of 0.24-0.58. The most informative predictors are found to be the overlap of friends between two individuals, and the clustering coefficient of their non-overlapping friends. These findings are consistent with 1) Granovetter\'s hypothesis: the stronger the tie between any two individuals, the higher the fraction of friends they share in common, and 2) Bott\'s hypothesis: the higher the degree of clustering in an individual’s network the less likely to form a tie with somebody outside the group.', 'Essay 3: Venmo for Change: The Effect of Digital Donations on Customer Engagement', ""In today's competitive and connected environment, organizations are investing in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities to differentiate themselves and create a meaningful engagement with their customers. Digital platforms have reemphasized this need by introducing new forms of donating mechanisms that use social cues to inform the users about a fundraising event. Research has documented the benefits of CSR activities to organizations in terms of enhanced consumer perceptions of the company, but there is little empirical evidence on the effect of digital platform donations on customer engagement as this is expressed by any potential interaction two existing users might have on the platform.  In this work, we propose a setting to empirically explore this question. Specifically, we use data from charitable fundraising events in Venmo to investigate whether two users that have contributed to the same charity event and have not previously transacted up to that point in time are more likely to transact after the charity event. Our charitable events are created by exogenous random shocks (e.g., physical catastrophes), which allow us to causally identify the effect of donations on customer engagement. We seek to test whether donating to a common cause increases the likelihood of forming a relationship between two users and whether this likelihood is a decreasing function of the shortest path distance between the two users.""]",1/1/2018,Operations Management,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_609781\Loupos_northwestern_0163D_14363.pdf,,,,,,,

This dissertation presents various techniques that can resolve the simulation challenges in charged systems and applies them to uncover the significance of electrostatic interactions in those systems. ', 'We first present the mathematical formulations for the variational approach that solves the polarization in dielectric heterogeneous systems. We use this method to compute the surface polarization of ion-containing droplets. For water droplets immersed in oil, the interdroplet interaction is attractive, and the surface polarization makes the major contribution. By contrast, for oil droplets in water, the ion-surface induced charge interaction is repulsive and counteracts the attraction between the ions, leading to a small attractive interaction between the droplets. This research improves our understanding of self-assembly in mixed phases such as metal extraction for recovering rare earth elements and nuclear waste as well as water purification. Then we consider asymmetric 2:1 and 3:1 electrolyte bounded by a sinusoidally deformed solid surface. We demonstrate that even when the surface is neutral, the electrolyte acquires a non-uniform ion density profile near the surface. The profile is asymmetric and leads to the effective charging of the surface. We furthermore show that the charge is modulated by the local curvature. The effective charge is opposite to that of the multivalent ion and is negative at concave regions of the surface. The ion distribution could be altered if there are charged molecules at the interface. ', 'Later, we develop the Monte-Carlo method that self-consistently solves the dynamical dissociation state of amphiphile molecules. Together with a theoretical model, we find that electrostatic effects arising from the inhomogeneity of the interfacial medium are responsible for this strong selectivity between two chemically similar lanthanide ions. Our results show that the interface plays an essential role in separating lanthanides during solvent extraction. We also use the Monte-Carlo simulations and pH titration measurements reveal that ionic correlations in the peptide amphiphile (PA) assemblies shift the ionizable amine pK $\\sim$ 8 from pK $\\sim$ 10 in the lysine headgroup. Our studies correlate the molecular charge and the morphology for a pH-responsive PA system and provide insights into the \\AA-scale molecular packing in such assemblies. In another project, we use simplified theoretical models based on the interplay between electrostatic, bending, van-der Waals and surface energies qualitatively reproduce the experimental observations of the increase in bilayer aspect ratio, membrane rolling and the changes in the inter-bilayer spacing as a function of NaCl concentration. We find the narrow ribbon to sheet transition is a first order phase transition. Overall, our studies correlate electrostatic interaction with the morphological changes of the membrane, and provide a means for attaining and controlling the cochleate morphology. In particular, we speculate that the tunable inter-bilayer spacing can be used for controlled encapsulation and release of macromolecules of different sizes for drug-delivery applications.', 'Last, we further extend our studies to the ion dynamics in charged system. Transport of ionic species in heterogeneous polymeric media is highly dependent on the charge distributions and interactions between mobile and immobile groups. Here we perform coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the ion dynamics in swollen polyelectrolyte gels under external electric fields. A nonlinear response of the ionic conductivity to an applied electric field, for field strengths that are comparable to the ionic coupling strength, is observed. This behavior correlates to a broadening of the ionic distribution around the polymer backbone under an increasing electric field. Also, we find that the weak-field ionic mobility in gels increases with density, which is opposite to the behavior of simple electrolytes. This relates to the mean coupling between charges that decreases in gels, but increases in simple electrolytes, with increasing density. These results provide more insights into the electric response of polyelectrolyte gels to support the development of applications that combine electric and mechanical properties of polyelectrolyte gels for energy storage, sensing, selective transport, and signal transfer.']",1/1/2018,Applied Physics,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_609812\Li_northwestern_0163D_14364.pdf,,,,,,,

As an emerging novel technology, Double-Sided Incremental Forming (DSIF) offers much higher flexibility with the complete elimination of the need for geometry-specific forming dies, and significantly reduces the forming time and cost in sheet metal production. However, challenges in achieving tight geometric tolerances at a reasonably short forming time and in maintaining structural integrity in incrementally formed parts limit the wide industrial adoption of the technology, even after decades of intensive laboratory developments worldwide.  Due to the strong nonlinear nature of the DSIF process caused by material plasticity, geometric variations, and varying local contact conditions between the workpiece and the forming tool(s), only a few models succeeded in determining process inputs (such as toolpaths) to achieve the desired part geometry. However, each model was applicable only to a specific process parameter combination or geometry. Moreover, as a flexible process, IF is often performed under a vast variety of potential process parameter combinations, such as different sheet metal materials, sheet thickness, tool diameters, lubricating conditions and clamping forces, which further signify the difficulty in establishing a single generalized model that encompasses all these parameter variations. ', 'The central idea of the thesis, in response to the above-mentioned challenges and hurdles, is to explore and realize a control framework integrated with a mechanics-based model for the purpose of enhancing geometric accuracy and suppressing possible fracture. To bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial applications for DSIF, the control framework is designed with high control accuracy, sufficient generalization capability and easy pragmatic instrumentation setup in mind.  The envisioned framework integrates three control loops at different levels to ensure accurate tool positioning, consistent maintenance of the desired tool contact pressure, and effective springback compensations for DSIF. Specifically:', '\uf076\tA real-time tool co¬¬mpliance compensation and a real-time contact force control algorithm are introduced to compensate for tool compliance and motion error, providing a stable contact pressure and avoiding any early loss of contact between the tool and the part. The implementation of a contact stiffness model increases the algorithm’s generality and robustness for different machine setups and material choices. Both algorithms are directly superimposed over the conventional position servo control loop with minimal modifications and proven to be effective over a large range of process parameters with reasonable control accuracy (< 10 N deviation for a 300 N command force). The purpose of this control loop is to ensure the realization of a true DSIF process, which has demonstrated its effectiveness in achieving tight geometric tolerance, delaying fracture, and increasing fatigue life compared to single point incremental forming.', '\uf076\tA feedforward toolpath optimization algorithm is established during the off-line planning stage to reduce the geometric error for a newly developed Accumulative Double-Sided Incremental Forming (ADSIF) toolpath strategy. Two process parameters that determine the relevant tool positions, i.e., position angle and gap, are proposed, for the first time, to capture the bending and squeezing phenomena in ADSIF. These process parameters are then optimized with a response surface model as a function of the local geometric wall angle. A significant error reduction of 80% is achieved using the developed response surface model. The defined optimization framework can be implemented in ADSIF without the need for any feedback sensor as the starting process condition is well-defined and consistent throughout the process. Consequently, it should be noted that this strategy for geometric control is suitable for ADSIF only. A more general strategy for DSIF is to be shown next.', '\uf076\tAn on-line springback compensation algorithm is established, which dynamically modifies the toolpath to compensate for potential springback based on an accelerated FEM-based springback prediction model. The springback prediction model is a first-of-a-kind real-time model that links the target variable (final part geometry) to measurable process variables (forming forces). Moreover, since the FEM model can be easily adopted to different sheet materials, part geometries and boundary conditions, the predictive model can thus be easily generalized to all these parameter changes. A customized unsupervised classification algorithm is also proposed, for the first time, to extract the key control points for a given complex geometry, so that springback prediction only needs to be conducted at a limited number of selected locations. The experimental results demonstrate that springback error can be limited within the 1.5 mm range for the tested geometries, compared to more than a 5 mm geometric error for the uncontrolled parts. ', 'To summarize, this work directly combines the control and modeling efforts to develop a systematic control framework for DSIF that improves part accuracy/contact conditions with three control loops operating at different time scales. Specifically, the introduction of feedback control into the DSIF process permits a more error-/disturbance-tolerant model, while the establishment of the process mechanics model helps to determine the proper control strategy and increases control robustness. Moreover, the framework, built on a solid foundation of process mechanics, is designed with a low implementation cost, a non-machine-intrusive setup, and a high model generality, thus guarantying a great potential of the work to be scaled up from laboratory prototypes to industrial applications. In doing so, this work successfully improves various aspects of DSIF, and paves the way for continued commercial implementation of the DSIF technology in the near future.']",1/1/2018,Mechanical Engineering,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_609832\Ren_northwestern_0163D_14365.pdf,,,,,,,

Symbolic reasoning has been used in many applications by making use of expressive symbolic representations to encode prior knowledge, conduct complex reasoning and provide explanations. Recently, machine learning has enabled various successful applications by learning from a large amount of noisy data. In this thesis, I propose to integrate these two approaches to build more expressive, efficient and interpretable learning systems. The main idea is, instead of training a model to predict the output directly, training a model to generate symbolic representations and then predict the output based on the generated symbolic representations. Incorporating symbolic representations into machine learning helps the model conduct complex reasoning, leverage external knowledge sources and learn more efficiently with better inductive biases. The main challenge is that the symbolic representations are usually hard to collect because it requires expertise, so we propose to induce them from weak supervision, which is much easier to collect. We analyze the challenges when learning from weak supervision and propose several novel techniques in reinforcement learning and latent structured prediction to overcome the problems. The proposed approach is investigated in two settings. In the first setting, to estimate the similarity between two relational structures, we use the structural alignment between them as the symbolic representation, which is then fed into a classifier to estimate their similarity. Experiments have shown that, with the inductive bias from structural alignment, the learned model achieves results competitive to state-of-the-art on paraphrase identification and knowledge base completion benchmarks while being much simpler or using orders of magnitude less data. In the second setting, we use compositional programs as the symbolic representations, which can be executed against a knowledge base or database tables to answer open-domain questions. By generating programs, the model can leverage existing knowledge and operations to perform complex reasoning compositionally. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end model without feature engineering that significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art results on two very competitive semantic parsing benchmarks. Besides, I will also show that the generated symbolic representations, e.g., the structural alignment and the programs, can be inspected and verified by the users, which makes the model more interpretable and easier to debug.']",1/1/2018,Computer Science,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_609841\Liang_northwestern_0163D_14366.pdf,,,,,,,

Studies on migrant “illegality” have generally focused on its political, legal and economic production and the social impact of a state’s specific biopolitics.  While invaluably important, there remains the need to better understand the modes of life people create “outside of the law” and the various ways everyday practice engenders social worlds of profound personal meaning that traverse state borders.  In this dissertation, I approach migrant “illegality” as a historically constituted social field in which people create social worlds despite the overt and covert affront to personhood.  I argue such social worlds are marked by a unique quality of waiting embedded in the category of the “illegal” migrant that precipitate an everyday suspension of normative systems of moral meaning.  ', 'Rather than focus on migrant “illegality” as a nullification of personhood, in this dissertation I approach “irregular” status as a state of exception that must be managed at the local level without violating strict state laws.  Based on two years of fieldwork in and around what came to be known as “irregular settlements” in Barcelona, Spain, this dissertation interrogates local government strategies to regulate an “irregular” segment of the non-citizen population in the city and the everyday struggles of “irregular” working class citizens to maximize tenuous spaces into transnational places of heightened autonomy.  Deportation has been codified in Spanish immigration law as a natural conclusion to “illegal” status but its execution at the local level is often inviable.  I draw from my ethnographic fieldwork in buildings transformed into sites for housing and informal labor by working class non-citizens Barcelona to explore local institutional mechanisms to incorporate “undocumented” residents within its immediate realm of action.  While migrant “illegality” implies a kind of conscribed existence that today pivots on a humanitarian imperative to maximize life, I argue these “irregular settlements” shed light on the value of spaces marked by a radical autonomy to people as they waited for “papers” or an opportunity to use them.  In other words, these settlements were much more than a humanitarian crisis in need of an immediate intervention; they represent a complex social world of profound transnational value.', 'Turning to everyday experience, I argue the ill effects of migrant “illegality” are mitigated when a person has access to spaces in which they manage a sense of self informed by transnational economies of moral value.  To wait “with one’s arms crossed” was untenable to the Senegalese men who participated in this study, despite the fact that they were often accused of “doing nothing” by interlocutors in public and private institutions.  This dissertation examines this disjuncture between competing models of “being a correct person” by turning to an analysis of moral and ethical codes.  Whereas from an institutional perspective such marginal spaces were morally and ethically untenable, I found everyday activities aimed at “getting by” consolidated into routines that progressively engendered a social world of special value to people bearing the brunt of migrant “illegality.”  To explore the moral and ethical codes emergent in the interstices of laws and policies, I suggest the term outpost to designate a place that is politically and legally tenuous but of special value to working class non-citizens struggling to remain in Spain and sustain a sense of self within the context of structural violence.

Examples of visual regression include many emerging but very difficult tasks, e.g., articulated human pose estimation, accurate gaze estimation, single-image super-resolution, age estimation from facial image, etc.', 'Visual regression still remains a very challenging task, even though large amount of research efforts have been devoted to this area for decades. When the explicit relationship between input and output is not available, the mapping from input and output needs to be learned from training dataset. However, this mapping function could be highly nonlinear and extremely complex. Traditional methods purse a holistic mapping which fits the training data, e.g., regression forests, support vector regression, regression networks. Nevertheless, this kind of methods require painstaking off-line training process.

With the rapid growth of computational power and big data, ""regression-by-searching"" takes the advantage of high-quality exemplars, and shifts part of the computation from off-line to on-line. The core idea is to search similar cases when one testing input comes. By shifting computation from learning complex mapping function to searching similar cases, it is able to capture the complex mapping, as it actually performs piecewise local regression. Moreover, it is more adaptable to new training data compared with holistic regression methods.', 'Though the proposed regression framework has many advantages, there are still several challenging problems to address. One crucial issue of searching-based visual regression is visual similarity, which is one of the most fundamental problems in computer vision. When the image search gives bad matches, it could ruin the regression result.

We address the issues of similarity modeling and local regression modeling from the perspective of space alignment. With approach of metric learning and novel objective of manifold alignment, the proposed methods effectively adjust the similarity metric in the input space to align with the output space.

This process must take into account the animal’s embodiment – the morphology, physiology, biomechanics, and affordances of bodies – because the body is the intermediary between the brain and the world. The present work begins by describing the embodiment of the rat whisker system in detail, first at the level of individual whisker morphology and then at the level of the entire whisker array.

They usually include multiple phases of materials to create unique properties that are not accessible to their homogeneous counterparts. The traditional design approach in the material science community is to use trial-and-error iteratively, which is bounded by its high costs and time-consuming procedure of new materials synthesis. It also largely depends on the researchers’ experiences to choose new designs and thus becomes less effective when the design space is vast. There are three significant challenges in the design of heterogeneous materials system: design representation, design evaluation, and design synthesis. This dissertation addresses these issues associated with advanced heterogeneous materials design by developing a data-driven computational framework.', 'A spectral density function based (SDF) approach is established to characterize and reconstruct the complex quasi-random microstructures observed in heterogeneous materials systems, which allows convenient parameterization and reduction of the high dimensional structural design space. We covered three different methods for simulating microstructures based on SDF: the phase retrieval algorithm for 3D reconstruction of isotropic microstructure from 2D images; Gaussian random field (GRF) based approach for the fast generation of channel-type microstructures; the disk-packing algorithm for particle-based microstructures.

The SEM-based method combines feature extraction and feature selection to discover underlying patterns of descriptors as well as selecting physically meaningful design variables. Additionally, the method successfully addresses the redundancy issue in existing importance ranking method.', 'In heterogeneous materials design, it is commonly needed to optimize quantitative design variables and qualitative material factors simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce a novel latent variable (LV) approach to Gaussian process (GP) models for handling both quantitative and qualitative input variables. Existing GP methods for handling this mainly assume a different response surface for each combination of levels of the qualitative factors and relate them via a multi-response cross-covariance matrix. The proposed method maps each qualitative factor to an underlying numerical latent variable (LV), with the mapped value for each level estimated similarly to the covariance length-scale parameters. This provides a parsimonious GP parameterization that treats qualitative factors the same as numerical variables and views them as affecting the response via similar physical mechanisms. We Observed superior predictive performance of the LV approach across a variety of examples. Moreover, the mapped LVs provide substantial design insight into the nature and effects of qualitative factors.', 'Finally, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) method for heterogeneous materials design, in which the SDF approach is used for representing design space of microstructures, and the latent variable GP model is employed as the surrogate model for further statistical inferences. With appropriate sequential sampling criteria, the BO material design flow effectively balances the exploitation of existing data and exploration of unknown feasible design space. Via two benchmark mixed-variable design problems: high-performance light absorption solar cell and searching the combinatorial space of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite, we demonstrated that the proposed BO method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art BO method in dealing with design optimization problems involving both quantitative and qualitative input variables.']",1/1/2018,Mechanical Engineering,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_609968\Zhang_northwestern_0163D_14372.pdf,,,,,,,

With respect to fiber-shaped nanomaterials such as carbon nanofibers (CNF), many studies have shown that mechanical strength properties of cementitious materials can be improved significantly. In this dissertation, the research has focused on the development of nanomodified cementitious materials with CNF. With relatively low CNT dosages (0.05% to 0.1% to cement weight) and a unique dispersion approach, uniform incorporation of CNT into a cementitious matrix is possible.  The beneficial increase in properties such as flexural strength, fracture roughness, modulus of elasticity, autogenous shrinkage, shrinkage cracking resistance, and electrical conductivity are all of particular note.  For the case of flexural strength and modulus of elasticity, the percentage improvement in properties with CNT is larger with mortar and concrete than it is with cement paste– this unexpected result implies that nano- and micro-structural changes are occurring in the presence of CNT at interfacial transitional zone between bulk paste and aggregates. To approve above statement, nano-scale metrology techniques have been adopted to investigate mechanical and chemical properties of ITZ in CNF reinforced cement concrete. The samples of cement mortar and cement concrete with and without CNFs are prepared. The quantitative nano-mechanical mapping (based on atomic force microscopy, AFM) technique is adopted to measure the Young’s modulus of ITZ.

Over the past two decades, researchers have documented the disparate impacts that zero-tolerance policies have had on students of color, low-income students, and students with disabilities (Advancement Project, 2000; Browne, 2003; Losen & Gillespie, 2012; Losen & Skiba, 2010; Skiba et al., 2002; Skiba & Peterson, 1999; Welch & Payne, 2010). Government officials at both the federal and local level are increasing efforts to guide school districts away from suspension policies and towards less punitive discipline strategies (Owens 2015, Willert 2015). National statistics show that there has been a decrease in out-of-school suspensions. During the 2015-2016 school year, 2.7 million students received one or more out-of-school suspensions--an almost 22 percent decrease from just four years earlier (US Department of Education, 2018). Yet, racial and gender disparities remain. For example, black male students make up 8 percent of the student population, but 25 percent of all students who received an out-of-school suspension. Comparatively, white females represent 24 percent of the student population, but account for only 8 percent of all students who received at least one out-of-school suspension (Ibid 2018). These racial disparities are particularly distressing since out-of-school suspensions are significantly correlated with poor attendance, lower academic achievement, high school dropout, juvenile justice system involvement, and unemployment (Advancement Project, 2000; Baker et al, 2001; Browne, 2003; Eaton, 2010; Fabelo et al, 2011; MacGillivary et al, 2008; Monahan et al., 2014; Sweeten, 2006; Wehlage & Rutter, 1986). ', 'Despite growth in the literature on school suspensions and discipline, there are still several areas that are not well understood. My dissertation helps address some of these gaps. In my first study, I explore whether bias contributes to the current gender and racial disparities in out-of-school suspensions by examining how gender and race bias influences adult perceptions of youth as troublemakers. Additionally, I analyze how students’ gender and race influence teachers’ interpretations of and responses to students’ actions. My second study builds a causal understanding of how Chicago’s suspension reduction policy impacts student outcomes. The current literature has little empirical evidence of the causal relationship between suspensions and student outcomes. While previous studies link suspensions to bad academic and life outcomes, there is little to indicate that this relationship is causal. There could be many reasons why suspended students receive poor grades and have more interactions with the juvenile justice system that have nothing to do with suspension themselves. I use the difference-in-differences method to estimate the causal relationship between suspension reductions and freshmen year academic and nonacademic outcomes. Finally, my last study uses qualitative data to develop an understanding of students’ suspension experiences and how they talk about fairness throughout the suspension process.']",1/1/2018,Human Development and Social Policy,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_610071\Lai_northwestern_0163D_14375.pdf,,,,,,,

According to this model, the Bavli consists of a normative, non-narrative, legal discourse alongside an antinomian, narrativized discourse of stories. Through close readings of passages that address legal topics, this dissertation complicates that model by revealing the narrative elements that are inherent in even what might seem like the most technical legal sugyot (passages). This insight, along with a historical contextualization of the Bavli’s shift towards increased narrativity during the rise of scholastic academies in Sassanian Persia, reveals new insights into the nature of the Bavli’s legal texts and of the Rabbinic legal project more broadly.', 'The three chapters of the dissertation demonstrate that legal sugyot exhibit specific literary elements: plot; characterization; and a complex engagement with narration, including the use of unreliable narrators. Close readings of these passages show that narrative elements at times dictate the focus of sugyot more than legal concerns do. In fact, this narrative drive comes to take precedence over legal aims such as the solution of logical problems or the production of useable rules.', 'The dissertation also reveals a correspondence between increased narrativity and increased redactorial activity. Scholars have argued that much of the Bavli’s redaction occurred contemporaneously with the growth of scholastic culture, and have also demonstrated a connection between scholasticism and narrativity in both exegetical and lengthy narrative passages. The increasingly narrativized nature of the Bavli’s legal texts must likewise be situated in the context of the rise of scholasticism.', 'This dissertation suggests that the increased narrative richness of the Bavli’s legal passages helped to create a new kind of interpretive community, inviting the reader’s engagement with legal concepts through the creation of compelling imaginary worlds, as well as encouraging the reader’s identification with the characters of the rabbis whose legal discussions are dramatized. The legal passages’ heightened narrativity is thus shown to be an essential component of the formation of a robust text-centered community of Rabbinic Jews.']",1/1/2018,Religious Studies,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_610079\Wolf_northwestern_0163D_14376.pdf,,,,,,,

By directly combining many individual components in a compact, scalable and robust way, photonic chips open the possibility for creating optical and electro-optical devices that could not be practical with discrete components. The applications for this technology are broad and far-reaching, ranging from commercial telecommunications uses to fundamental experiments which probe the physical nature of light. ', 'In this work, we focus on novel devices targeted for quantum optics applications that harness the advantages of these integrated systems towards problems in information processing and fundamental research. In order to achieve these goals, we target devices that manipulate and generate quantum states of light. This work will present simulation and experimental results form a host of integrated materials and layouts.', 'First we will discuss simulation efforts for a receiver design that can selectively manipulate high-dimensional photonic signals in overlapping temporal modes. This lithium-niobate waveguide based experiment relies on precise pump waveforms to extract the target signal mode with high selectivity. The simulation and optimization efforts presented here support the experimental work carried out by other members of this group.', 'To complement our receiver scheme, we present a CMOS-compatible platform for telecom C-band photon pairs. This chip is based on a novel integrated waveguide which uses hydrogenated amorphous silicon as the guiding material. This short, 8-mm chip produces photon-pairs in far-detuned multiple wavelength channels simultaneously with a coincidence-to-accidental ratio as high as 400. With insignificant Raman scattering over a spectrum of at least 5 THz, this material holds promise for large-scale quantum applications, especially those based on multiplexed photon sources.', 'Next, we present work in silicon nitride ring and disk resonators. With a moderate chi 3, but no two-photon absorption for light near 1550 nm, this material has been shown to be highly versatile for chip-based based nonlinear optics in the near infrared. In this work, we investigate all-optical switching behavior which can route and filter quantum signals without introducing degrading in-band spontaneous noise. Finally, we present simulation and preliminary experimental work towards phase-sensitive stimulated and spontaneous cascaded four-wave mixing which can be used to manipulate frequency comb generation of classical or quantum signals.

Central to this study is how under racial capitalism, women of color, albeit differentially, are subject to various forms of control, such as spatial containment, security cameras, and isolation, that enforce their submission, confining and suppressing their movements for capitalist (re)production. The following performances attune us to crucial acts that are counterintuitive—acts that adhere to rather than resist these conditions. This dissertation, hence, departs from the traditions of Marxist criticism, ethnic studies, and feminist theory that emphasize workers’ action as resistance. By deploying a performance studies approach, I advance a black and women of color feminist intervention that centers performances of inactivity as strategic acts to navigate and negotiate the often impossible conditions of racial slavery and low-wage flexible labor. ', 'Inactivity uses archival and close-reading methods that draw from the fields of performance studies, critical ethnic studies, feminist and queer theory, Marxist Theory, and visual culture. It provides an interdisciplinary study that challenges dominant conceptions of workers’ action as overtly visible, defiant, and oppositional to the current order (e.g., protests, boycotts, and revolts). It does so by assembling the work of five artists of color—Kat Eng, Beili Liu, Ramiro Gomez, Kara Walker, and Andrea Chung—who bring our attention to acts that are ', 'ambiguous, not readily visible, and not doing. Foregrounding inactive forms—slowness, stillness, and negation—that mark the body as passive, docile, and compliant, this dissertation asks, how might racialized and feminized attributes be mobilized and inhabited, and what might these acts enable and allow for within the confines of labor? Performances of inactivity, as I suggest, withhold revealing, rendering the worker’s subsequent actions and movements as unknowable from the eyes of the spectator, slaveholder, or employer. This dissertation seeks to expand and recalibrate what we might see as action, attending to the profound yet dismissed ways women of color act and subsist under racial capitalism.']",1/1/2018,Performance Studies,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_610128\Chung_northwestern_0163D_14378.pdf,,,,,,,

The innermost layer, the nucleocapsid, initially assembles as an immature procapsid precursor built around viral scaffold proteins. The event that initiates procapsid maturation is unknown but it is dependent upon activation of the internal protease. Scaffold cleavage triggers angularization, or transformation into a polyhedral form, of the shell and its decoration with the accessory capsid-surface proteins – the capsid vertex specific component and the small capsid protein. In both the procapsid and mature angularized capsid, the apical region of the major capsid protein is surface exposed. I investigated whether the major capsid protein apical region contributes to intracellular transport dynamics following entry into primary sensory neurons and also tested the hypothesis that conserved negatively-charged amino acids in the apical region contribute to acquisition of the small capsid protein. To my surprise neither hypothesis proved true. Instead, mutation of glutamic acid residues in the apical region delayed viral propagation and induced focal capsid accumulations in nuclei. ', 'This dissertation reports on the fortuitous discovery that a region of the major capsid protein that is exposed on the outer surface of the capsid also contributes to capsid maturation. Examination of capsid morphogenesis based on epitope unmasking, capsid composition, and ultrastructural analysis indicated that the glutamic acid mutant focal accumulations consisted of procapsids. The results demonstrate that, in addition to established events that occur inside the capsid, the exterior capsid shell promotes capsid morphogenesis and maturation of the megastructure. ', 'In addition, this dissertation presents a modified fluorescent fusion protein design that produced the first described procapsid-specific tag. In this design, a fluorescent protein open reading frame is fused to the amino-terminus of the protease and includes the protease cleavage site immediately following the fluorescent protein’s sequence. Consequently, the fluorescent protein is cleaved from the protease upon its activation during capsid maturation and the fluorescent signal is lost from the megastructure. This procapsid-specific tag not only allows for the identification of procapsids in living cells by a single fluorescent marker but also might serve as a fluorescent readout of protease activity.']",1/1/2018,Driskill Graduate Training Program in Life Sciences,Dissertation,None,no embargo,\etdadmin_upload_610135\Ruhge_northwestern_0163D_14379.pdf,,,,,,,

While classic qualitative studies in higher education have provided rich portraitures of academic life in college, less is known about the degree to which the academic experiences of students are, too, socioeconomically disparate. This three-article-format dissertation explores whether and how social class shapes the academic experiences of students and specifically how students form and navigate academic peer networks in ways that reproduce socioeconomic inequalities. The dissertation is based on a qualitative case study of a top-ranked engineering school at an elite private university where I conducted in-depth interviews with a socio-demographically diverse sample of engineering students and administrators, as well as ethnographic observations of various activities within the engineering school. Drawing on literature at the intersection of culture, inequality, and education, I argue that the sorting and navigation of academic peer groups are driven by the interaction between students’ class-based cultural, social, and economic resources and the institutional practices and structures of the university. I find that through the prevalence of institutionalized quantitative measures used to academically rank students, students learn to compete with their peers for academic status through a process of selective collaboration. In addition, I show that cultural similarity operating at the individual, institutional, and micro-interactional levels contributes to the creation and reproduction of segregated academic peer groups. All of the aforementioned processes have unintended consequences for the concentration of learning opportunities among the most affluent and privileged students. The findings make scholarly contributions to theories of cultural and social reproduction at the postsecondary level and introduce new mechanisms through which peer networks and their internal dynamics contribute to the reproduction of educational disparities. The dissertation also has clear implications for higher education practice and policy in an effort to reduce educational inequalities through academic peer groups in an era of peer collaborative learning approaches.']",1/1/2018,Sociology,Dissertation,"code: 1, date: 10/03/2020",Private,\etdadmin_upload_610193\Johnson_northwestern_0163D_14380.pdf,,,,,,,
